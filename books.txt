review: At the end of the day, Web services aren't hard to conceptualize. They're just a bunch of software modules with specific rules about how they go about discovering one another and sending messages back and forth. Implementation is another story, however. In the Java language, writing Web services requires an understanding of half a dozen specialized APIs at minimum, and more than that if you want to do fancier stuff. <I>Java Web Services</I> does a very good job of dispersing the confusing terminology (and obfuscating hype) and of showing you exactly how to <I>do</I> Web services work in Java. This doesn't sound like a revolutionary concept, but unfortunately it is. David Chappell and Tyler Jewell have comfortably fit into less than 250 pages what others have not done as well in twice as much space.<p>Take Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) work as an example. UDDI exists to help software locate other software that does what it wants. How do you do that? Chappell and Jewell present two concise program listings--a client and a server--that show how to do a  UDDI lookup. They then refine their code by using a third-party API that makes the work easier. Similarly pragmatic attention goes to Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), in which they show how to create a message, populate it with XML, make an attachment if necessary, and send it on its way. You won't find a lot of frills or conceptual explanations (though there are enough "why" sections to ensure that you're not just typing recipes blindly); the emphasis is on writing Java code that interacts with Web services protocols and standards. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to write Web services software in Java, with respect to Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). There's also coverage of interprocess communication under JAX-RPC and ways to implement security. All of the low-level stuff is here. Look elsewhere for architecture and design information.

review: A unique treatment of signal processing using a model-based perspective<br>   <br>   Signal processing is primarily aimed at extracting useful information, while rejecting the extraneous from noisy data. If signal levels are high, then basic techniques can be applied. However, low signal levels require using the underlying physics to correct the problem causing these low levels and extracting the desired information. Model-based signal processing incorporates the physical phenomena, measurements, and noise in the form of mathematical models to solve this problem. Not only does the approach enable signal processors to work directly in terms of the problem's physics, instrumentation, and uncertainties, but it provides far superior performance over the standard techniques. Model-based signal processing is both a modeler's as well as a signal processor's tool.<br>   <br>   Model-Based Signal Processing develops the model-based approach in a unified manner and follows it through the text in the algorithms, examples, applications, and case studies. The approach, coupled with the hierarchy of physics-based models that the author develops, including linear as well as nonlinear representations, makes it a unique contribution to the field of signal processing.<br>   <br>   The text includes parametric (e.g., autoregressive or all-pole), sinusoidal, wave-based, and state-space models as some of the model sets with its focus on how they may be used to solve signal processing problems. Special features are provided that assist readers in understanding the material and learning how to apply their new knowledge to solving real-life problems.<br>   * Unified treatment of well-known signal processing models including physics-based model sets<br>   * Simple applications demonstrate how the model-based approach works, while detailed case studies demonstrate problem solutions in their entirety from concept to model development, through simulation, application to real data, and detailed performance analysis<br>   * Summaries provided with each chapter ensure that readers understand the key points needed to move forward in the text as well as MATLAB(r) Notes that describe the key commands and toolboxes readily available to perform the algorithms discussed<br>   * References lead to more in-depth coverage of specialized topics<br>   * Problem sets test readers' knowledge and help them put their new skills into practice<br>   <br>   The author demonstrates how the basic idea of model-based signal processing is a highly effective and natural way to solve both basic as well as complex processing problems. Designed as a graduate-level text, this book is also essential reading for practicing signal-processing professionals and scientists, who will find the variety of case studies to be invaluable.   <p>   An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available from the Wiley editorial department, Model-Based Signal Processing develops the ""model-based approach"" to signal processing for a variety of useful model sets including the popularly termed ""physics-based"" models. It presents a unique viewpoint of signal processing from the model-based perspective. A wide variety of case studies are included to demonstrate the applicability of the approach to real-world problems.   This book presents a unified treatment of the model-based approach and includes numerous case studies to demonstrate applicability of method to real-world situations, as well as MATLAB notes.

review: In this language-independent overview, developer Hamill covers the usage, philosophy, and architecture of unit test frameworks with the idea that they are development tools like pre-processors and debuggers. He offers code examples in C++ and Java, starting with a tutorial and proceeding to examine the xUnit family, writing unit tests, GUI applications, JUnit, CppUnit, NUnit, PyUnit, XMLUnit, and related resources. The CD-ROM includes build directions and Makefile comments.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionUnit test frameworks are a key element of popular development methodologies such as eXtreme Programming (XP) and Agile Development. But unit testing has moved far beyond eXtreme Programming; it is now common in many different types of application development. Unit tests help ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, improve developer productivity, and produce more robust software.  Until now, there was little documentation available on unit testing, and most sources addressed specific frameworks and specific languages, rather than explaining the use of unit testing as a language-independent, standalone development methodology. This invaluable new book covers the theory and background of unit test frameworks, offers step-by-step instruction in basic unit test development, provides useful code examples in both Java and C++, and includes details on some of the most commonly used frameworks today from the XUnit family, including JUnit for Java, CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET.   Unit Test Frameworks includes clear, concise, and detailed descriptions of:The theory and design of unit test frameworksExamples of unit tests and frameworksDifferent types of unit testsPopular unit test frameworksAnd moreIt also includes the complete source code for CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET.

review: Cross-platform file sharing under Network File System (NFS) is  so reliable that in most organizations, it works pretty much  unattended. Ditto for the directory services that Network Information  System (NIS) provides. <I>Managing NFS and NIS</I> is for people who  want to know more about how NFS and NIS do their vital work, and how to  make them operate in unusual circumstances. Focused on the Solaris and  Linux implementations of NFS and NIS, this book is ideal for the Unix  system administrator who's familiar with TCP/IP networking and everyday  system administration. The second edition of this book eliminates much  of the programming material that appeared in its predecessor and  replaces it with information on NFS 3, its support of IPsec and  Kerberos security, and its operation under Solaris 8.<p>This is a blue  O'Reilly book, packed to the gunwales with information of interest to  people in a hurry to optimize their systems and resolve difficulties.  It's easy to locate the passage you need via the index or through the  table of contents, and most entries provide a great mix of how-to  material (in the form of input-and-output listings) and explanatory  text (expert commentary, often with notes on applicable variations). If  there's a command, option, or configuration parameter associated with  NIS or NFS, you'll find documentation of it here. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Network File System (NFS) and Network  Information System (NIS) for Unix machines, especially Solaris (through  version 8) and Linux (through version 2.2). Auto mounting, security,  diskless workstations, and performance tuning are among the many  details the authors address.

review: The birth of new modules for the Perl scripting language is a regular occurrence, and the publication of an O'Reilly book about one of these modules is a sign of coming of age. Perl's DBI module, which facilitates the database-independent operation of Perl, achieves its rite of passage this month with the arrival of Alligator Descartes and Tim Bunce's excellent <I>Programming Perl's DBI</I>. Perl's DBI interface is maintained by Bunce and includes submodule interfaces to Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, Microsoft ODBC, and many other smaller databases. O'Reilly Perl book aficionados take note: this is the cheetah book, named for the animal that graces its cover.<p> Far from being a formalized how-to or man page, <I>Programming Perl's DBI</I> is a mini textbook in database programming,  ideal for CPAN-savvy Perl programmers with little or no experience in database programming. Descartes and Bunce develop primitive notions of databases by using flat files, and they introduce relational databases with careful didactic motivation. The example database used throughout the book contains ancient sacred monolithic sites in the UK and elsewhere, of which Stonehenge is the most famous. Readers will learn about these primitive places while storing, updating, deleting, sorting, and locking their descriptors using flat files, nonrelational and relational databases, and a tutorial on SQL. The last chapters describe the peculiarities of interacting with ODBC and introduce DBI's Perl-less diagnostic shell and database proxying.<p> The authors use many modules--including DBI itself--that are not part of the vanilla Perl distribution, and Descartes and Bunce introduce them without explaining where to find or build them. Perl newbies with no CPAN experience may find themselves derailed early. The Storage module seems not to be available on CPAN at all (at the time of this writing). Fortunately, DBI and friends build, test, and install seamlessly under Linux/Red Hat 6.1.<p> At 350 pages, <I>Programming the Perl DBI</I> is 60 percent text--filled with highly annotated Perl code--and 40 percent appendices covering a detailed specification of DBI and 3-to-5-page descriptions of each of the 14 supported databases. Brevity is a large component of this book's wit. Clarity is the rest of it. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: One of the great early claims of cyberculture was that the Net constituted a realm distinct from the "real world," with a life and laws all its own. This book argues strongly to the contrary. Not only is cyberspace an integral part of the real world, Dan Schiller insists, but it exists primarily to serve powerful real-world economic interests--none of which are necessarily aligned with the principles of individual freedom and equal access commonly touted as the Internet's defining values.<p> In Schiller's reckoning, it was neither Al Gore, the Pentagon bureaucracy, nor a subculture of long-haired hackers that brought digital networks into being. Rather, it was large corporations in the '40s and '50s that were looking to expand operations across national borders. Through big business's economic demand for sophisticated networking tools, and more importantly, through its direct political demands for deregulated digital telecommunications, these corporate interests carved out the technosocial realm we now know as cyberspace. The Internet thus stands as both symptom and fulcrum of the broader trend toward globalization that is the hallmark of the political economy of the late 20th century.<p> In Schiller's view, that trend is a decidedly bad thing, and he spends much of the book outlining what he sees as its deleterious effects on economic equality, media culture, and higher education. These are unabashedly anticapitalist sentiments, but whether or not you agree with them, Schiller's account of the relationship between corporations and cyberspace demands to be reckoned with. <I>--Julian Dibbell</I>

review: Hooray for Joseph Sloan, who has written <I>Network Troubleshooting Tools</I>. Sloan's book catalogs--and evaluates, with intelligent and carefully researched commentary--scores of free utilities that have been developed for monitoring, managing, and troubleshooting TCP/IP networks large and small. As such, it's a guide to the tools of the network administration trade. Without the concentrated wisdom that's found here, a network administrator might take years to stumble across all the fantastically useful utilities described in these pages, and waste all kinds of effort in the process. This book has found an excellent niche: a high-level technical book that earns its cover price by applying an author's experience and research to stuff that's freely available online, thus adding to readers' abilities to exploit the free stuff that's out there. <p>  The organization Sloan has chosen is interesting and efficient. Chapters deal with categories of utilities, such as packet sniffers and device mapping. Chapters begin with descriptions of the general purpose of utilities in their category and describe features (and alternate means of providing them) in general terms. Then come sections on utilities, complete with commentaries on the strengths of each and command-line dumps of the utilities in use. As utilities often are best used together, the author does a good job of showing what steps to take when that needs to be done. There's no companion CD-ROM, but the URLs that link to the utilities appear--sorted alphabetically by the programs' names, in an appendix. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The free utilities--mostly for Unix variants--that the author has found to be most useful in his work as an administrator and troubleshooter of TCP/IP networks. Utilities for route tracing, packet sniffing, device detection, performance measurement, and other work are covered here.

review: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are revolutionizing digital signal processing as novel FPGA families are replacing ASICs and PDSPs for front-end digital signal processing algorithms. So the efficient implementation of these algorithms is critical and is the main goal of this book. It starts with an overview of today's FPGA technology, devices, and tools for designing state-of-the-art DSP systems. A case study in the first chapter is the basis for more than 30 design examples throughout. The following chapters deal with computer arithmetic concepts, theory and the implementation of FIR and IIR filters, multirate digital signal processing systems, DFT and FFT algorithms, and advanced algorithms with high future potential. Each chapter contains exercises. The VERILOG source code and a glossary are given in the appendices, while the accompanying CD-ROM contains the examples in VHDL and Verilog code as well as the newest Altera "Baseline" software. This edition has a new chapter on adaptive filters, new sections on division and floating point arithmetics, an up-date to the current Altera software, and some new exercises.

review: Perfect for migrating to Java from a fellow object-oriented language  (such as C++), the second edition of <I>Thinking in Java</I> continues the  earlier version's thoughtful approach to learning Java inside and out, while  also bringing it up to speed with some of the latest in Java 2 features. This  massive tutorial covers many of the nooks and crannies of the language, which is  of great value in the programming world.<p>  The most prominent feature of the book is its diligent and extremely thorough  treatment of the Java language, with special attention to object design. (For  instance, 10 pages of sample code show <I>all</I> of the available operators.)  Some of the best thinking about objects is in this book, including when to use  composition over inheritance. The esoteric details of Java in regard to defining  classes are thoroughly laid out. (The material on interfaces, inner classes, and  designing for reuse will please any expert.) Each section also has sample  exercises that let you try out and expand your Java knowledge.<p>  Besides getting the reader to "think in objects," <I>Thinking in Java</I> also  covers other APIs in Java 2. Excellent sections include an in-depth tour of  Java's collection and stream classes, and enterprise-level APIs like servlets,  JSPs, EJBs, and RMI. Weighing in at over 1,000 pages, any reader who is serious  about learning Java inside and out will want to take a look at this superior  resource on some of the latest and most advanced thinking in object design.  <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <table cellspacing="7"  border="0"><ul><ol><tr><td><li>Object-design basics <li>Inheritance and  polymorphism <li>Object lifetimes <li>Exception handling <li>Multithreading and  persistence <li>Java on the Internet <li>Analysis and design basics <li>Java  basics: keywords and flow control <li>Initializing objects <li>Garbage  collection <li>Java packages <li>Designing for reuse: composition vs.  inheritance <li>The <I>final</I> keyword <li>Interfaces and inner classes  <li>Arrays and container classes <td><br><td><li>Java I/O classes <li>Run-time  type identification <li>UI design basics with Swing <li>Deploying to JAR files  <li>Network programming with sockets <li>JDBC database programming  <li>Introduction to servlets <li>JavaServer Pages (JSPs) <li>RMI <li>CORBA  <li>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and Jini <li>Cloning objects <li>The Java Native  Interface (JNI) <li>Java programming guidelines</ol></ul></table>

review: Cascading Style Sheets can put a great deal of control and flexibility into the hands of a Web designer--in theory.  In reality, however, varying browser support for CSS1 and lack of CSS2 implementation makes CSS a very tricky topic.  <I>Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide</I> is a comprehensive text that shows how to take advantage of the benefits of CSS while keeping compatibility issues in mind.<p>  The book is very upfront about the spotty early browser support for CSS1 and the sluggish adoption of CSS2. However, enthusiasm for the technology spills out of the pages, making a strong case for even the most skeptical reader to give CSS a whirl and count on its future. The text covers CSS1 in impressive depth--not only the syntactical conventions but also more general concepts such as specificity and inheritance.  Frequent warnings and tips alert the reader to browser-compatibility pitfalls.<p>  Entire chapters are devoted to topics like units and values, visual formatting and positioning, and the usual text, fonts, and colors.  This attention to both detail and architecture helps readers build a well-rounded knowledge of CSS and equips readers for a future of real-world debugging.  <I>Cascading Style Sheets</I> honestly explains the reasons for avoiding an in-depth discussion of the still immature CSS2, but covers the general changes over CSS1 in a brief chapter near the end of the book.<p>  When successfully implemented, Cascading Style Sheets result in much more elegant HTML that separates form from function.  This fine guide delivers on its promise as an indispensable tool for CSS coders.  <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B>  <ul> <li>HTML with CSS  <li>Selectors and structure <li>Units  <li>Text manipulation  <li>Colors and backgrounds  <li>Boxes and borders  <li>Visual formatting principles  <li>Positioning  <li>CSS2 preview <li>CSS case studies </ul>

review: As developers know, the beauty of XML is that it is extensible, even to the point that you can invent new elements and attributes as you write XML documents.  Then, however, you need to define your changes so that applications will be able to make sense of them and this is where XML schema languages come into play. RELAX NG (pronounced relaxing), the Regular Language Description for XML Core--New Generation is quickly gaining momentum as an alternative to other schema languages.  Designed to solve a variety of common problems raised in the creation and sharing of XML vocabularies, RELAX NG is less complex than The W3C's XML Schema Recommendation and much more powerful and flexible than DTDs.  RELAX NG is a grammar-based schema language that's both easy to learn for schema creators and easy to implement for software developers In RELAX NG, developers are introduced to this unique language and will learn a no-nonsense method for creating XML schemas. This book offers a clear-cut explanation of RELAX NG that enables intermediate and advanced XML developers to focus on XML document structures and content rather than battle the intricacies of yet another convoluted standard.  RELAX NG covers the following topics in depth:Introduction to RELAX NGBuilding RELAX NG schemas using XML syntax Building RELAX NG schemas using compact syntax, an alternative non-XML syntaxFlattening schemas to limit depth and provide reusabilityUsing external datatype libraries with RELAX NGW3C XML Schema regular expressionsWriting extensible schemasAnnotating schemasGenerating schemas form different sourcesDeterminism and datatype assignmentand much more.  If you're looking for a schema language that's easy to use and won't leave you in a labyrinth of obscure limitations, RELAX NG is the language you should be using.  And only O'Reilly's RELAX NG gives you the straightforward information and everything else you'll need to take advantage of this powerful and intelligible language.

review: Moock, a developer in the Flash community, covers ActionScript 2.0 syntax as well as object-oriented design and object-oriented programming (OOP) in this guide for ActionScript developers and experienced OOP developers coming from another language such as Java or C++. The book teaches object-oriented concepts, syntax, and usage, then outlines best practices for setting up and building an object- oriented project, and shows how to apply widely accepted OOP strategies and design patterns to Flash.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn September 2003, Macromedia released Flash MX 2004, and with it, ActionScript 2.0, a dramatically improved version of Flash's programming language.  ActionScript 2.0 introduces a formal object-oriented programming syntax and methodology for creating Flash applications.  From a developer's perspective, the new OOP-based techniques in ActionScript 2.0 make applications more natural to plan and conceptualize, more stable, more reusable across projects, easier to maintain, change, and expand upon, and much more. In short, they enhance the entire development process.  In Essential ActionScript 2.0, bestselling author Colin Moock--one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community--covers everything you'll need to know about the new ActionScript language and its methodologies for producing movies, animation, and applications on the web. Moock guides readers through this important new territory with his trademark easy-to-understand style and expertise. Moock's goal throughout the book is not just to get you to use object-oriented programming in your daily Flash work: he wants you to reap the benefits of OOP; he wants you to understand ActionScript 2.0 completely.  And without question, Moock is the author who can make this happen.  Essential ActionScript 2.0 begins with a tour of the language, including the fundamentals of object-oriented concepts, syntax, and usage. Those who are new to OOP will learn the basics and how to apply their understanding. Those who are familiar with OOP will leverage their prior experience to learn about Flash-based OOP. The next part of the book shows how to structure entire applications with ActionScript 2.0, teaching you best practices and techniques to build scalable, extensible, stable apps. Next, you'll explore a variety of approaches to various programming situations by applying object-oriented programming strategies, known as design patterns, to Flash.   Experienced Flash developers and programmers coming from other languages will enjoy the sheer depth of Moocks's coverage and expertise in Essential ActionScript 2.0. Novice programmers will appreciate the frequent, low-jargon explanations that are often glossed over by advanced programming books.  As usual, Moock guarantees quality and accuracy by working closely with Macromedia Flash engineers, including Rebecca Sun, lead developer of ActionScript 2.0.  Whether you're ready to make the move to ActionScript 2.0 now or simply assessing it for the future, you'll find everything you need to know within this book. Essential ActionScript 2.0 is the one book every ActionScript coder must own.

review: The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) rating  is difficult to earn and rare in the marketplace, which means you're a valuable  commodity if you've proven your skills by passing the exam. <I>The CISSP Prep  Guide</I>, one of only a handful of books on its subject, does a good job of  giving readers a feel for the scope of the test and the style of its questions.  It's ideal for use either as a preliminary survey of the CISSP subject  areas (the test's publisher and the authors of this book call them  "domains") for relative newcomers to computer security, or as a pure study guide  to help more experienced professionals zero in on the weak spots in their  knowledge. Don't expect to do well on the CISSP exam having only read this book.  You'll want to have some practical experience and some specialized reading under  your belt.<p>Ronald Krutz and Russell Vines are good writers and fine teachers;  they explain the wide-ranging CISSP domains (which have to do with everything  from cryptographic algorithms to fire-suppression techniques to legal  principles). They take care to explain potentially unfamiliar terms--there's a  good glossary in the back of this book--and employ conceptual diagrams well.  However, the answer keys for the sample questions that conclude each chapter  aren't annotated and some readers will wish for more references to specialized  sources. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> The subjects covered by the Certified Information Systems  Security Professional (CISSP) exam published by the International Information  Systems Security Certification Consortium, including cryptography, access  control, security policy, legal matters, and the physical safety of information,  equipment, and people.

review: Reasoning that the best way to defend a computer system is to possess a detailed knowledge of the techniques malicious punks could use to attack it, Peikari and Chuvakin have written a detailed tutorial. The book is in four broad sections: software cracking, which details techniques of reverse engineering on Windows, Windows CE, and Linux systems; network stalking--on techniques used to compromise computer networks; platform attacks--covering ways to exploit vulnerabilities in specific software programs such as Unix and SQL Server; and finally a section on advanced defensive techniques such as honeypots.  Although little familiarity with computer security techniques is assumed, an intermediate to advanced level of general computer knowledge is required; the software cracking section, for example, provides a brief refresher tutorial in assembly language, but would swiftly confuse anyone encountering the material for the first time.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionWhen it comes to network security, many users and administrators are running scared, and justifiably so.  The sophistication of attacks against computer systems increases with each new Internet worm.  What's the worst an attacker can do to you?  You'd better find out, right?  That's what Security Warrior teaches you.  Based on the principle that the only way to defend yourself is to understand your attacker in depth, Security Warrior reveals how your systems can be attacked.  Covering everything from reverse engineering to SQL attacks, and including topics like social engineering, antiforensics, and common attacks against UNIX and Windows systems, this book teaches you to know your enemy and how to be prepared to do battle.  Security Warrior places particular emphasis on reverse engineering.  RE is a fundamental skill for the administrator, who must be aware of all kinds of malware that can be installed on his machines -- trojaned binaries, spyware that looks innocuous but that sends private data back to its creator, and more.  This is the only book to discuss reverse engineering for Linux or Windows CE.  It's also the only book that shows you how SQL injection works, enabling you to inspect your database and web applications for vulnerability.  Security Warrior is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book covering the art of computer war: attacks against computer systems and their defenses.  It's often scary, and never comforting.  If you're on the front lines, defending your site against attackers, you need this book.  On your shelf--and in your hands.

review: Using Linux is designed to meet the reader s needs by focusing on the problems and concerns of the beginning to intermediate Linux user. It will help them manage and use their systems more effectively.   Most books in this category are geared mostly toward installation and configuration, they have very little content which helps the user on a day-to-day basis. This book will give the reader the information the other books do have, in addition to what they leave out. The effective use of cross-references and index aliases found in the Using series makes it easy for the reader to find the information they need quickly, even when they are not sure what to look for.  The author will be using Red Hat 5.0 Linux software as a base for this book. Red Hat Linux is the number one Linux system today. There is a need for a good beginner-intermediate book on the new 5.0 version of the software  -More and more people, and corporations, are beginning to choose Linux for its performance, endurance and stability.  -This complete reference will show the reader how to install, manage and use their Linux system productively.  -Linux is a free Unix-like operating system whose user base has grown 6,000% over the past four years.

review: Thoroughly enhanced for the EJB 1.1 specification, <I>Enterprise JavaBeans, 2nd Edition</I> provides a great introduction to the world of server-side Java components. With plenty of material on EJB architecture and design, this new edition can serve as an authoritative resource for mastering today's bean standards.<p> Besides a general introduction to EJBs, the new edition of this book excels at highlighting the differences between the EJB 1.0 and 1.1 standards. Sample code is provided for both versions. For deployment, EJB 1.1 now relies on XML to define all bean resources and dependencies. For every sample bean, the author provides the XML, as well as the old-style Java code for EJB 1.0. There's also plenty of coverage of the new reliance on JNDI (the Java directory service) in EJB 1.1 and other late-breaking Sun standards, such as combining EJBs with servlets and JSPs for delivering dynamic Web content.<p> This text is organized as a tutorial to the major types of EJBs with full coverage of entity beans (for accessing databases) and session beans (for managing "conversations" with particular clients). The author covers all the bases here with numerous diagrams describing the life cycle of beans and how they cooperate with today's application servers. As in the first edition, sample beans for a cruise ship booking application let you see actual EJB code in action. Helpful appendices list all EJB APIs and other useful information (such as a list of current EJB vendors).<p> In all, the revised edition of <I>Enterprise JavaBeans</I> shows off the considerable strengths of the new EJB 1.1 standard. Suitable for any working Java programmer or IT manager, the clear presentation of the strategies and techniques for successful component design help make this book a smart choice for successful development with EJBs. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Overview of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) v. 1.1 and 1.0, distributed objects, Component Transaction Monitors (CTMs), application servers and EJBs, resource management, EJB server setup, entity beans, session beans and workflow, the JNDI naming service, the life cycle of beans, container-managed and bean-managed persistence for entity beans, stateful and stateless session beans, deploying beans in JAR files (EJB 1.1 and 1.0 conventions), XML deployment descriptors, transaction basics (ACID properties and JTS), EJB security, design strategies and performance tips for EJBs, Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) and EJBs, servlets and JSPs used with EJBs, sample beans, state and sequence diagrams for EJBs, and EJB API reference.

review: When a technology such as the Web is first introduced, the primary concern is making sure that the technology works. As we become more experienced with designing web sites, the problem no longer remains the technical infrastructure but rather becomes how we can make a web site that is easy to use and meets the needs of the user.  As a result, many web sites are being designed utilizing a user-centered development process. User-Centered Web Design guides readers through the process of designing user-centered resources that are based on feedback from the end user. User-Centered Web Design; will take the reader through the entire development process: From the initial idea of developing a web site, determining the mission of the web site, collecting the requirements, designing the pages, performing usability tests, and eventually implementing and managing a web site.About the AuthorDr. Jonathan Lazar is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, and an Affiliated Professor in the Center for Applied Information Technology, both in the College of Science and Mathematics at Towson University. Dr. Lazar earned his Ph.D. in Information Systems at the University of Maryland. Dr. Lazar regularly teaches courses in Web Design, Human-Computer Interaction, and Systems Analysis and Design. Dr. Lazar was named the Towson University Faculty Advisor of the Year in May, 2000.

review: Intended for experienced software developers, this book provides instructions for setting up the Mono development environment on Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X, overviews the major features of the C# programming language, and introduces the system class libraries. Later chapters discuss the Gtk# user interface toolkit, APIs for XML- related programming, and ASP.NET libraries for web applications and web services.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe Mono Project is the much talked-about open source initiative to create a Unix implementation of Microsoft's .NET Development Framework.  Its purpose is to allow Unix developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET applications. The project has also sparked interest in developing components, libraries and frameworks with C#, the programming language of .NET.    The controversy?  Some say Mono will become the preferred platform for Linux development, empowering Linux/Unix developers. Others say it will allow Microsoft to embrace, extend, and extinguish Linux. The controversy rages on, but--like many developers--maybe you've had enough talk and want to see what Mono is really all about.    There's one way to find out: roll up your sleeves, get to work, and see what you Mono can do.  How do you start? You can research Mono at length. You can play around with it, hoping to figure things out for yourself. Or, you can get straight to work with Mono: A Developer's Notebook--a hands-on guide and your trusty lab partner as you explore Mono 1.0.  Light on theory and long on practical application, Mono: A Developer's Notebook bypasses the talk and theory, and jumps right into Mono 1.0.  Diving quickly into a rapid tour of Mono, you'll work through nearly fifty mini-projects that will introduce you to the most important and compelling aspects of the 1.0 release.  Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll learn how to acquire, install, and run Mono on Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.  You'll work with the various Mono components: Gtk#, the Common Language Runtime, the class libraries (both .NET and Mono-provided class libraries), IKVM and the Mono C# compiler. No other resource will take you so deeply into Mono so quickly or show you as effectively what Mono is capable of.   The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Mono, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution.

review: While the day when Web documents will engage all five of the senses remains far away, <I>Designing Web Audio</I> makes it clear that there's much more to creating stylish pages than pretty graphics and carefully chosen fonts. Internet broadcasts of music and voice make use of the network in a way that was impossible three years ago. Music and audio effects, selected with an artist's ear and implemented with careful engineering, can add a lot to surfers' page-viewing experiences without placing undue strain on their Internet connections. Authors Josh Beggs and Dylan Thede--with combined experience in the Internet and commercial recording industries--show  (technically, and to some extent artistically) how to send sound over the Internet for the enjoyment of all and sundry.<p>  <I>Designing Web Audio</I> recognizes that many readers won't know much about recording and editing techniques, and so devotes some space to microphone placement, levels, equalization, and other techniques that aren't specific to Internet audio. Once that's out of the way, the book digs into specific encoding and broadcast tools, such as RealAudio and Beatnik. Coverage of these tools is comprehensive, and code samples complement explanatory text. Embedded audio, Macromedia Flash, and synchronized audio-video presentations are also explained. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Sound, voice, music, and how to communicate them over the Internet <li>Good recording and editing practices <li>Streaming media <li>RealAudio <li>RealSystem G2 <li>Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) <li>MP3 <li>Macromedia Flash and Shockwave <li>Beatnik</ul>

review: Intended for web designers familiar with HTML and JavaScript, this book collects 89 techniques for enhancing web pages with cascading style sheets (CSS). The solutions provide code snippets for setting font color and type, controlling the presentation of a link, styling the basic list items, working around the ways browsers render forms, creating column layouts, and making a page printer-friendly.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionCascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a powerful way to enrich the presentation of HTML-based web pages, allowing web authors to give their pages a more sophisticated look and more structure. CSS's compact file size helps web pages load quickly, and by allowing changes made in one place to be applied across the entire document, CSS can save hours of tedious changing and updating.   But to leverage the full power of CSS, web authors first have to sift through CSS theory to find practical solutions that resolve real-world problems. Web authors can waste hours and earn ulcers trying to find answers to those all-too-common dilemmas that crop up with each project. The CSS Cookbook cuts straight through the theory to provide hundreds of useful examples and CSS code recipes that web authors can use immediately to format their web pages.   The time saved by a single one of these recipes will make its cover price money well-spent. But the CSS Cookbook provides more than quick code solutions to pressing problems. The explanation that accompanies each recipe enables readers to customize the formatting for their specific purposes, and shows why the solution works, so you can adapt these techniques to other situations. Recipes range from the basics that every web author needs to code concoctions that will take your web pages to new levels.  Reflecting CSS2, the latest specification, and including topics that range from basic web typography and page layout to techniques for formatting lists, forms, and tables, it is easy to see why the CSS Cookbook is regarded as an excellent companion to Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide and a must-have resource for any web author who has even considered using CSS.

review: Web developers rely on XML to separate data from presentation and create a consistent templating system for a web site.  Although limited XML-to-HTML conversion is possible within some browsers, web developers creating dynamic or complex sites will find server-side XML transformation a necessity. Unfortunately, until recently, there have been few XML tools available for server-side XML transformation or authoring.  AxKit, a mod_perl and Apache-based XML content delivery solution, was designed to meet that need with a cost-effective and efficient plugin architecture. AxKit allows the developer to quickly design modules to create faster web sites, and deliver them in a wide variety of media formats. AxKit also takes care of caching so the developer doesn't have to worry about it. AxKit meets the demands of the web developer nicely, but, as with any new toolkit, there is a learning curve.   For developers who want to flatten that learning curve and get right to work with AxKit, XML Publishing with AxKit provides detailed information on how to install, configure, and deploy AxKit effectively. The first book solely devoted to AxKit, XML Publishing with AxKit also offers a concise and focused look at how to create XSLT and XPathScript-based pipelines for XML data transfer.   This solidly useful new book presents web programmers with the hands-on knowledge they need to get really creative with AxKit. It features a thorough introduction to XSP (extensible Server Pages), which applies the concepts of Server Pages technologies (embedded code, tag libraries, etc) to the XML world, and covers integrating AxKit with other tools such as Template Toolkit, Apache:: Mason, Apache::ASP, and plain CGI. The book also includes invaluable reference sections on configuration directives, XPathScript, and XSP.   With XML Publishing with AxKit, web developers will have all the tools they need to deliver complex XML-based systems quickly, the power to develop their own systems for style sheet negotiation, and the flexibility to design completely new style sheet languages.  XML Publishing with AxKit gives those new to XML all the background and the courage they need to jump right in and deploy AxKit. And it gives XML-savvy professionals everything they need to hit the ground running.

review: Steven Feuerstein's first book, Oracle PL/SQL Programming, has become  the classic reference to PL/SQL, Oracle's procedural extension to its  SQL language.  His new book looks thoroughly at one especially advanced  and powerful part of the PL/SQL language -- the package.  The use of  packages can dramatically improve your programming productivity and code  quality, while preparing you for object-oriented development in Oracle  technology.  In this book, Feuerstein explains how to construct  packages -- and how to build them the right way.  His best practices  for building packages will transform the way you write packages and help  you get the most out of the powerful, but often poorly understood, PL/SQL  language.  Much more than a book, Advanced Oracle PL/SQL Programming with Packages comes with a PC diskette containing a full-use software companion.  Developed  by Feuerstein, RevealNet's PL/Vision Lite is the first of its kind for  PL/SQL developers: a library of thirty-plus PL/SQL packages.  The packages  solve a myriad of common  programming problems and vastly accelerate the  development of modular and maintainable applications.Book InfoLooks thoroughly at one especially advanced part of the PL/SQL language - the package, the use of which can dramatically improve programming productivity and code quality.

review: Although the name Tiger may not be official yet, the 100-plus substantial changes to the core language and numerous additions to the library and API definitely are. Printed on graph paper with room for notes, this book bypasses the theoretical and focuses on the practical, starting with new features in arrays, queues, overriding return types, Unicode and StringBuilder. Chapters that follow include generics, enumerated types, autoboxing and unboxing, varangs, annotations, the for/in statement, static imports, formatting, and threading. Each topic starts with a brief explanation followed by examples and application tips.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionJava 5.0, code-named Tiger, promises to be the most significant new version of Java since the introduction of the language. With over a hundred substantial changes to the core language, as well as numerous library and API additions, developers have a variety of new features, facilities, and techniques available.  But with so many changes, where do you start? You could read through the lengthy, often boring language specification; you could wait for the latest 500 page tome on concepts and theory; you could even play around with the new JDK, hoping you figure things out--or you can get straight to work with Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook.  This no-nonsense, down-and-dirty guide by bestselling Java authors Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan skips all the boring prose and lecture, and jumps right into Tiger. You'll have a handle on the important new features of the language by the end of the first chapter, and be neck-deep in code before you hit the halfway point. Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll get complete practical coverage of generics, learn how boxing and unboxing affects your type conversions, understand the power of varargs, learn how to write enumerated types and annotations, master Java's new formatting methods and the for/in loop, and even get a grip on concurrency in the JVM.  Light on theory and long on practical application, Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook allows you to cut to the chase, getting straight to work with Tiger's new features. The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Tiger, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution.

review: <I>Firewalls</I> is a guide to protecting an Internet-connected network from external threats--a complex task. You not only need to be aware of the known vulnerabilities of your system, you also need to remain alert to potential attacks. Firewalls are tools that help you do this by controlling access to and from your network.<p> This book teaches the basics of network operation and how a firewall is put together. It's important to understand risk, and the book helps explain risk management and how it impacts a security policy. You'll also see how hackers target and penetrate systems. There's a guide to TCP/IP and common Internet services. From this base camp, <I>Firewalls</I> begins to climb the mountain of Internet security. The basic technologies and security requirements that fit together to form a firewall are introduced, along with the security policies of the authors' "perfect firewall."<p> A large section of the book is taken up with comparative reviews of most of the main freeware and commercial firewall products currently available. This is a useful tool that gives you everything you're likely to need when deciding how to choose a firewall for your network.<p> <I>Firewalls</I> is a very practical book aimed at the experienced network administrator who may be unfamiliar with Internet security. Real-world examples and plenty of tips and warnings make this a welcome addition to the system administrator's bookshelf. <I>--Simon Bisson, Amazon.co.uk</I>

review: <I>Thinking in Java</I> is a printed version of Bruce Eckel's online materials that provides a useful perspective on mastering Java for those with previous programming experience. The author's take on the essence of Java as a new programming language and the thorough introduction to Java's features make this a worthwhile tutorial.<p> <I>Thinking in Java</I> begins a little esoterically, with the author's reflections on why Java is new and better. (This book's choice of font for chapter headings is remarkably hard on the eyes.) The author outlines his thoughts on why Java will make you a better programmer, without all the complexity. The book is better when he presents actual language features. There's a tutorial to basic Java types, keywords, and operators. The guide includes extensive source code that is sometimes daunting (as with the author's sample code for <I>all</I> the Java operators in one listing.) As such, this text will be most useful for the experienced developer.<p> The text then moves on to class design issues, when to use inheritance and composition, and related topics of information hiding and polymorphism. (The treatment of inner classes and scoping will likely seem a bit overdone for most readers.) The chapter on Java collection classes for both Java Developer's Kit (JDK) 1.1 and the new classes, such as sets, lists, and maps, are much better. There's material in this chapter that you are unlikely to find anywhere else.<p> Chapters on exception handling and programming with type information are also worthwhile, as are the chapters on the new Swing interface classes and network programming. Although it adopts somewhat of a mixed-bag approach, <I>Thinking in Java</I> contains some excellent material for the object-oriented developer who wants to see what all the fuss is about with Java.

review: This comprehensive guide to JavaServer Pages (JSPs), a fast-growing technology for Web developers, teaches you how to embed server-side Java into Web pages, while also offering full access to other features such as JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and JDBC database access. The reference JSP implementation is the freely available Apache Tomcat server, so it won't cost a thing to get started. All the example code in the book has been tested on Tomcat, in fact.  The first part of JavaServer Pages covers the essentials of HTTP and Java Servlets, on which JSPs are based. There is also a guide to installing Tomcat on your Windows or Unix system. The next part, aimed at Web page designers as well as programmers, covers JSP application development. There is material on scripting elements, error handling, managing user sessions, database access, security, and using XML and XSL with JSP. Part 3, for programmers, broadens the scope to include EJB and other Java components, developing custom tags, and achieving highly scalable applications using database connection pools. A comprehensive reference section finishes things off.  The author has been an active participant in the official servlet and JSP working groups, and this book is both well informed and well organized. It provides experts with invaluable tips and insights, while newcomers will find all they need to assess and implement their first JSP applications. --Tim Anderson, Amazon.co.uk --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.Book DescriptionWritten by a key contributor not only to the JSP specification, but also to the JSP and Servlet reference implementations, the second edition of this comprehensive guide to JavaServer Pages shows you how to embed server-side Java into Web pages, while also offering full access to other features such as JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and JDBC database access. In addition, this book covers the new Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL) in exhaustive detail-- in fact, most of the examples are updated to use this groundbreaking new technology from Sun Microsystems, Inc.  Filled with useful examples and the depth, clarity, and attention to detail that made the first edition so popular with web developers, JavaServer Pages, 2nd Edition is completely revised and updated to cover the substantial changes in the 1.2 version of the JSP specifications, and includes coverage of the new JSTL Tag libraries-an eagerly anticipated standard set of JSP elements for the tasks needed in most JSP applications, as well as thorough coverage of Custom Tag Libraries.

review: Good programming--which is to say, programming that yields both efficient code and a profitable life for the programmer--depends on not reinventing the wheel. If someone else has solved the problem you're facing (and someone almost always has), you'd be foolish to waste your energy figuring out your own solution. <I>MySQL Cookbook</I> presents solutions to scores of problems related to the MySQL database server. Readers stand a good chance of finding a ready-made solution to problems such as querying databases, validating and formatting data, importing and exporting values, and using advanced features like session tracking and transactions. Paul DuBois has done a great job assembling efficient solutions to common database programming problems, and  teaches his readers a lot about MySQL and its attendant APIs in the process.<p>DuBois organizes his cookbook's recipes into sections on the problem, the solution stated simply, and the solution implemented in code and discussed. The implementation and discussion sections are the most valuable, as they contain the command sequences, code listings, and design explanations that can be transferred to outside projects. The main gripe readers will have about <I>MySQL Cookbook</I> is that the author, in his effort to cover the range of MySQL-friendly programming languages, uses different languages in his solutions to various problems. You'll see a Perl solution to one programming challenge (Perl, in fact, is the most frequently used language, followed by PHP), a Python fix for the next, and a Java sample after that. Readers have to hope that they find a solution in the language they're working with, or that they're able to transliterate the one DuBois has provided. It's usually not a big problem.  <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to make MySQL databases do your bidding--in terms of queries, table manipulation, data formatting, transactions, and Web  interfaces--through the database server's command line interfaces and (more importantly) through the MySQL APIs of Perl, PHP, Java, and Python. Particularly excellent coverage deals with formatting dates and times, management of null values, string manipulation, and import/export techniques.

review: Abelson and Sussman's classic <I>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</I> teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.<P> The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?"<P> The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming., <I>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</I> has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text.<br /> <br /> There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published.<br /> <br /> A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.<br /> <br /> In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.

review: As the title implies, <I>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 7.0</I> examines SQL Server from the inside out, investigating the technical workings of this complex database product. Author Kalen Delaney has updated this popular title, penned originally by Ron Soukup. Both authors emphasize that <I>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 7.0</I> does not work well as an introductory tutorial but is designed to elevate existing SQL Server knowledge to the next level.<p> The initial 31-page overview describes the colorful history of SQL Server with an excellent rundown of composite technologies and important features of the database. A very insightful analysis of SQL Server's engine internals follows, which breaks down all of the various manager components and explains how they work.<p> The remainder of the book focuses on the intelligent implementation of SQL Server in a number of areas. A chapter on planning and installation gives an unusually detailed look at hardware and software strategies for high performance and reliability. The book then covers how to effectively work with databases, tables, queries, transactions, triggers, and cursors.<p> Each subject receives highly detailed coverage with the goal of enhancing your decision making skills with knowledge of the inner workings of the product. <I>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 7.0</I> is a database administrator's (DBA) gold mine--a rare treasury of in-depth product knowledge from true masters. <I>--Stephen Plain</I>

review: When the second edition of <I>Programming Perl</i> was released, the authors omitted two chapters: "Common Tasks with Perl" and "Real Perl Programs."

Instead, O'Reilly chose to release the many Perl code examples as a separate entity: <I>The Perl Cookbook</I>.<p> The recipes are well documented and the examples aren't too arcane; even beginners will be able to pick up the lessons taught here. The authors write in relatively easy-to-understand language (for a technical guide).

review: Developers who want to create dynamic, data-driven web sites running on Microsoft web servers have long relied on Active Server Pages (ASP). ASP.NET is Microsoft's latest evolution of ASP. While ASP.NET has a lot in common with its predecessor, this new technology takes advantage of object-oriented programming to dramatically improve developer productivity and convenience. Using the .NET Framework and Microsoft's new object-oriented languages, ASP.NET brings the same rapid drag-and-drop productivity to web applications that the Visual Basic programming language brought to Windows applications. ASP.NET also introduces web services, which allow developers to expose the functionality of an application via HTTP and XML, so that clients on any platform can access it via the Internet. ASP.NET is not a simple upgrade of ASP. It s a quantum leap ahead. There are many benefits to using ASP.NET, and one major drawback: the time developers must devote to mastering this new Web application technology.  The ASP.NET Cookbook provides a wealth of plug-and-play solutions to problems commonly encountered when developing ASP.NET web applications and services in the popular problem-solution-discussion  Cookbook  format. The coding solutions in ASP.NET Cookbook appeal to a wide range of developers, from the inexperienced to the expert. For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or recipe a short, focused piece of code that web developers can insert directly into their applications.  Developers can save hours by using just a single one of over 100 recipes included in this invaluable cookbook.   But the ASP.NET Cookbook provides far more than just a wide range of cut-and-paste code solutions. Each recipe is followed by a discussion including tips, tricks, and possible pitfalls--so developers can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to a myriad of similar situations. Each recipe provides an immediate solution to a pressing problem, while simultaneously allowing developers who prefer to a hands-on learning style with the experience they need to master ASP.NET. This ultimate ASP.NET code sourcebook will quickly earn the dog-eared corners and coffee rings that mark a web developer's most valued resource.

review: Fast becoming the standard language of commercial software development, C++ is an update of the C programming language, adding object-oriented features that are very helpful for today's larger graphical applications.<p><i>Practical C++ Programming</i> is a complete introduction to the C++  language for the beginning programmer, and also for C programmers  transitioning to C++.  Unlike most other C++ books, this book emphasizes  a practical, real-world approach, including how to debug, how to make your  code understandable to others, and how to understand other people's code.<p>Almost as important, this book is written in the readable style that has  made Nutshell Handbooks(R) famous.<p>Topics covered include:<ul><li>Good programming style</li><li>C++ syntax, what to use and what not to use</li><li>C++ class design</li><li>Debugging and optimization</li></ul><p>At the end of each chapter are a number of exercises you can use to make  sure you've grasped the concepts.  Solutions to most are provided.<p><i>Practical C++ Programming</i> describes standard C++ features that are supported by all UNIX C++ compilers (including <i>gcc</i>) and DOS/Windows  and NT compilers (including Microsoft Visual C++).<p><b>Comparison: <i>Practical C++ Programming</i> vs. <i>C++: The Core  Language</i></b><p>O'Reilly's policy is not to publish two books on the same topic for the same audience.  We'd rather spend twice the time on making one book the industry's best.  So why do we have two C++ tutorials?  Which one should you get?<p>The answer is they're very different.  Steve Oualline, author of the  successful book <i>Practical C Programming</i>, came to us with the idea  of doing a C++ edition.  Thus was born <i>Practical C++ Programming</i>.   It's a comprehensive tutorial to C++, starting from the ground up.  It also  covers the programming process, style, and other important real-world issues.   By providing exercises and problems with answers, the book helps you make  sure you understand before you move on.<p>While that book was under development, we received the proposal for<i>C++: The Core Language</i>.  Its innovative approach is to cover only a subset of the language -- the part that's most important to learn first -- and to assume readers already know C.  The idea is that C++ is just too complicated to learn all at once.  Instead, you learn the basics solidly  from this short book, which prepares you to start programming and to  understand some of the other C++ books you'll need for reference.<p>These two books are based on different philosophies and are for different  audiences.  But there is one way in which they work together.  If you are  a C programmer, we recommend you start with <i>C++: The Core Language</i>,  then read about advanced topics and real-world problems in <i>Practical C++  Programming</i>.

review: Java Web Services in a Nutshell begins with an introduction to Java web services, including a discussion of how they differ from web applications. The author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web services, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as the means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters cover:JAX-RPCSOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)Reliable SOAP messaging with JAXMWSDLAdvanced JAX-RPCJAXR, the XML-based registry APIWeb Services ToolsThe balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference containing documentation for the various API packages.  Intended for Java developers who need to implement Java services or who need their applications to access existing web services, Java Web Services in a Nutshell delivers practical information to help developers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized official documentation. If web services and Enterprise Java are any part of your job description -- of if you'd like them to be -- you'll want this book close beside as you work.

review: <I>Check Point NG</I> aims to teach its readers how to install and set up VPN-1/FireWall-1 Next Generation, the latest version of the highly respected firewall software from Check Point. Its authors--all with significant network and security certifications--accomplish their objective: it seems likely that this book will travel with a lot of Check Point consultants and stand ready on the shelves of many organizations' network security specialists. The book has plenty of unadorned how-to procedures that get straight to the point, and enough background information to help you make good designs and troubleshoot problems. The Syngress style, which incorporates a carefully considered list of questions and answers at the end of each chapter, suits this subject well. It's easy to locate sections of interest or to scan straight through and accumulate knowledge.<p>Your security requirements are unique, of course, but the authors do a good job of explaining how to satisfy common requirements and implement variations upon them. For example, they show how to configure Network Address Translation (NAT) in a general way, then--in a Q&A section--show how to combine sequentially numbered networks into a single network object for easy administration of rules. This is documentation worth having. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Installation of VPN-1/FireWall-1 and setup via the graphical user interface. There's deep coverage of security policies, naturally, and of user authentication, content filtering, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and Network Address Translation (NAT). The specifics of configuring for various protocols--including RPC and LDAP--are covered well.

review: Beginning PHP4 offers an almost ideal introductory tutorial to  one of today's hotter scripting languages. This book really is everything that  the novice needs to start building dynamic Web sites that are powered by PHP4,  but old hands at programming also will find in it valuable information.  PHP, of course, is introduced in the book, but there's also an approachable and  effective introduction to programming in general. The conscientious tutorial on  basic concepts like variables, keywords, and flow control will give even  beginners an understanding of the basics of writing programs. PHP, it turns out,  is not only a great way to generate HTML dynamically, but a very marketable  skill. Web fundamentals like HTTP, HTML form variables, and managing session  information using no less than four different techniques are explained  thoroughly and effectively. You also find out how to install PHP and other tools  on your system, with the assistance of plenty of screen shots.  That's not to say that this book will cramp the style of more experienced  developers. Some chapters delve into such important and advanced topics as  database programming (with MySQL) and PHP's support for XML. One standout  section demystifies the new support for objects and classes in PHP4. Basic  topics like managing files and directories on the server, plus graphics  processing, are addressed, of course, and a nifty sample program shows you how  to build a Web-based text editor. Except for the final case study--a URL  directory manager (akin to Yahoo!) that's rather specialized--the examples are  right on, and illustrate everyday programming tasks. You'll learn also how to  generate e-mail with PHP--certainly a valuable skill to have.  The appendix lists several hundred PHP functions in over 50 pages--a handy and  useful feature.

review: Intended for administrators who want to go beyond the tasks that can be performed from the Windows server GUI, this book provides scripts for managing users, the active directory, and networking services, and reveals techniques for copying and editing the metabase, deploying Windows 2000/XP/2003 and its components, and protecting a network from threats.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionOne of the secrets to the ever-increasing popularity of Windows Server can be found in the simplicity its administration. The easy-to-use GUI, consistent set of tools, and wizards that walk you through complex tasks allow you to install, configure and maintain Windows servers without any knowledge of programming or scripting languages or learning complicated command-line syntax. It's possible, in fact, to accomplish about 90% of all Windows administration without ever opening a command prompt or running a script!   But what about the other ten percent of the time? While it's true that most common, day-to-day tasks of Windows administration can be performed from the GUI, it's not always the best way, especially with complex or repetitive tasks Scripts and command-line tools often provide a faster, more flexible approach.  Windows Server Hacks reveals techniques that go well beyond basic management tasks found in most handbooks to help busy system administrators master the more powerful features of Windows Server.   Windows Server Hacks focuses on scripts and other tools that will make your life as an administrator much easier. These tools, or hacks--quick and dirty solutions to problems, or clever ways of doing things--were created by other professionals who've also had to struggle to find solutions to administering Windows environments. You'll save valuable time using their scripts, tools, tips, and advice. Plus, you can easily learn to customize the scripts to create even more powerful tools for your own, specific needs.  The book includes secrets of the masters in such areas as Active Directory, User Management, Group Policy, DNS and DHCP, File and Print, IIS, performance and security.  The hundred, industrial strength hacks in the book range from those that deal with general administration to more esoteric hacks in the areas of network deployment, patch management, and backup and recovery.    No matter which Windows server you use--NT, IIS, 2000, or 2003--this book will put the knowledge and expertise of veteran system administrators and hackers to work for you. Windows Server Hacks will make your life easier while expanding your understanding of the capabilities of Windows Server.

review: Single sign-on is the holy grail of network administration, and Kerberos is the only game in town.  Microsoft, by integrating Kerberos into Active Directory in Windows 2000 and 2003, has extended the reach of Kerberos to all networks large or small.  Kerberos makes your network more secure and more convenient for users by providing a single authentication system that works across the entire network. One username; one password; one login is all you need.  Fortunately, help for administrators is on the way.  Kerberos: The Definitive Guide shows you how to implement Kerberos for secure authentication.  In addition to covering the basic principles behind cryptographic authentication, it covers everything from basic installation to advanced topics like cross-realm authentication, defending against attacks on Kerberos, and troubleshooting.  In addition to covering Microsoft's Active Directory implementation, Kerberos: The Definitive Guide covers both major implementations of Kerberos for Unix and Linux: MIT and Heimdal.  It shows you how to set up Mac OS X as a Kerberos client.  The book also covers both versions of the Kerberos protocol that are still in use: Kerberos 4 (now obsolete) and Kerberos 5, paying special attention to the integration between the different protocols, and between Unix and Windows implementations.  If you've been avoiding Kerberos because it's confusing and poorly documented, it's time to get on board!  This book shows you how to put Kerberos authentication to work on your Windows and Unix systems.

review: The Java Desktop System (TM), from Sun Microsystems, is a modern system for all kinds of users, novice through expert. As an unusually robust, well-integrated desktop system, it may become the first to fulfill the promise of mass adoption for open source.  JDS brings Linux and other open source software up to a level of usability that makes them suitable for the enormous base of Personal Computer users including office workers, students, mobile and home users. It behaves pretty much the way a Windows or Mac user would expect, but with many more powerful features. JDS has seen widespread adoption in the United States, Britain, China, and elsewhere.  This book is the ideal guide to JDS: it is clear and direct, but loaded with insights from authors who have spent time working with, supporting, and enhancing the system. Tom Adelstein is an award winning polymath system designer; Sam Hiser is a respected business consultant with an itch that led him to become the marketing project lead for OpenOffice.org. Both are advocates for open source and founders of the Open Government Interoperability Project, members of the Open Source Software Institute and contributors to the JDShelp.org project.  This book carefully covers such housekeeping chores as setting up networking, updates, and backups. Then it enters into great depth concerning the key productivity tools every user needs: email, web browsing, instant messaging, word processing, spreadsheets, and slide presentations.  A number of chapters and appendices concerning useful tools, including things you can add to your system, rounds out this remarkably useful book. It has plenty to offer the new user as well as the seasoned Linux professional.

review: In this book/CD-ROM package, Rankin, a system administrator, explains how to use Knoppix, a bootable Linux CD distribution, to its full potential. He provides step-by-step instructions for using it as a desktop distribution, a rescue CD, and other tasks. Instructions are given for using Knoppix (provided on the accompanying CD-ROM) for troubleshooting, repairing, upgrading, disinfecting, and getting work done on any computer with a CD drive.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionKnoppix is a portable Linux distribution with a collection of hundreds of programs and utilities--a veritable Swiss Army knife in CD form. This practical and flexible Linux distribution runs on the fly  from a single CD with no need to install anything to your hard drive. Knoppix's excellent hardware detection, collection of programs, and ease of use help explain why Knoppix is radically changing the face of Linux. Though Knoppix is the most popular live CD Linux distribution available, until now there have been no books on the topic.  A weighty theoretical tome or a book for dummies won't do--the perfect Knoppix book, like Knoppix itself, must be as useful and clever as a Swiss Army knife. Clearly, Knoppix calls for an O'Reilly Hacks book.   Knoppix Hacks is a collection of one hundred industrial-strength hacks for new Linux users, power users, and system administers using--or considering using--the Knoppix Live CD. These tips and tools show how to use the enormous amount of software on this CD to troubleshoot, repair, upgrade, disinfect, and generally be productive without Windows. With Knoppix you can:Test drive a Linux desktop without the need to install LinuxTroubleshoot and repair Linux and Windows systemsCreate a thin client network with just one CDReplace a web server or firewall in an emergencyPerform a security audit on your entire networkVirus scan a Windows computer from the safety of LinuxCustomize Knoppix for personal or business useEasily install the popular Debian GNU/Linux distribution with all of your hardware detected and configuredKnoppix Hacks provides ingenious fixes, clever customizations, and time and resource-saving tips. If you want more than the average Knoppix user, this invaluable book is a must-have.

review: PHP and MySQL go hand in hand; the former has been carefully adapted, through the efforts of the open-source community, to the latter. For situations that require dynamic content but don't merit the complexity and development time of Java or .NET enterprise applications, the PHP language and the MySQL database server fit the bill perfectly. That's the point Hugh Williams and David Lane make in <I>Web Database Applications with PHP & MySQL</I>, which combines language tutorials with application design advice to yield a comprehensive picture of its subjects at a reasonable price. Williams and Lane--both Australian academics who use an online wine store in many of their examples--deserve tremendous kudos for their way of presenting recommended coding strategies. Though the code listings themselves aren't remarkably well commented, the authors do a commendable job of explaining in prose what the code is up to.<p>Case in point: The ever-essential task of using PHP to open a connection to a MySQL database, submit a query to that database, receive a response, and format the returned rows, if any. The book addresses this problem with a straight code listing, followed by text that explains what's happening in five numbered steps. Similar care goes to the other popular applications of the PHP/MySQL duo: session management, shopping carts, and authentication of users. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to use the PHP server-side scripting language and the MySQL database engine to underlie dynamic Web sites (those that rely on database queries) and full-on Web applications, such as those that require session management and maintenance of user rosters. Tutorials in both subjects begin with the basics and proceed through moderately complicated stuff, though there's no absolutely comprehensive reference here.

review: Macromedia Flash is the obvious choice for delivering multimedia over the Web. At the heart of Flash's power is ActionScript, the product's powerful object-oriented scripting language. ActionScript is based on JavaScript, making it easy for Web developers new to Flash to get up to speed. <I>ActionScript: The Definitive Guide</I> is a tutorial and reference to ActionScript that meets the needs of both new Flash developers learning the language and experienced coders who need a daily reference.<p>  Author Colin Moock starts off with a primer to Flash terminology and a quick example application--an interactive quiz. Following that, the book quickly gets down to ActionScript nuts and bolts. The first part covers the basics of the language, such as operators, variable scope, and conditional logic, in a traditional presentation. A few lines of example code illustrate each concept. <p>  Critical topics like arrays, movie clips, and object-oriented programming are covered well at the detail level, though a more extensive example application would really have come in handy to illustrate the big picture. The back of the book contains an excellent reference to the ActionScript language, complete with inline example code. ActionScript is an important tool to master, and <I>ActionScript: The Definitive Guide</I> is a fine means to that end. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I>

review: Uncertainty is a fundamental and unavoidable feature of daily life; in order to deal with uncertaintly intelligently, we need to be able to represent it and reason about it. In this book, Joseph Halpern examines formal ways of representing uncertainty and considers various logics for reasoning about it. While the ideas presented are formalized in terms of definitions and theorems, the emphasis is on the philosophy of representing and reasoning about uncertainty; the material is accessible and relevant to researchers and students in many fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, economics (particularly game theory), mathematics, philosophy, and statistics.  Halpern begins by surveying possible formal systems for representing uncertainty, including probability measures, possibility measures, and plausibility measures. He considers the updating of beliefs based on changing information and the relation to Bayes' theorem; this leads to a discussion of qualitative, quantitative, and plausibilistic Bayesian networks. He considers not only the uncertainty of a single agent but also uncertainty in a multi-agent framework. Halpern then considers the formal logical systems for reasoning about uncertainty. He discusses knowledge and belief; default reasoning and the semantics of default; reasoning about counterfactuals, and combining probability and counterfactuals; belief revision; first-order modal logic; and statistics and beliefs. He includes a series of exercises at the end of each chapter.Book InfoText examines formal ways of representing uncertainty and considers various logics for reasoning about it.

review: The authors of <I>Learning Python</I> show you enough essentials of the Python scripting language to enable you to begin solving problems right away, then reveal more powerful aspects of the language one at a time. This approach is sure to appeal to programmers and system administrators who have urgent problems and a preference for learning by semi-guided experimentation.<p> First off, <I>Learning Python</I> shows the relationships among Python scripts and their interpreter (in a mostly platform-neutral way). Then, the authors address the mechanics of the language itself, providing illustrations of how Python conceives of numbers, strings, and other objects as well as the operators you use to work with them. Dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other data structures specific to Python receive plenty of attention including complete examples.<p> Authors Mark Lutz and David Ascher build on that fundamental information in their discussions of functions and modules, which evolve into coverage of namespaces, classes, and the object-oriented aspects of Python programming. There's also information on creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Python applications with Tkinter.<p> In addition to its careful expository prose, <I>Learning Python</I> includes exercises that both test your Python skills and help reveal more elusive truths about the language.

review: You may not have heard of the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) or its professional certifications, but they're becoming an important part of proving professional competence in the Linux operating system. That aside, <I>LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell</I> is a fantastic introductory Linux book, well suited to introducing a curious newcomer to the environment and bringing an intermediate user up to expert status. <p>  The book is organized around the LPI's published standards for two Level 1 exams (exams 101, which deals with key commands and file-system concepts, and 102, which places more emphasis on hardware, networking, and shell scripting). The organization works well even if you're not specifically preparing for either exam.<p>  <I>LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell</I> assumes nothing in early chapters, going so far--to cite one example--as to walk readers through the concept of commands with parameters separately from the concept of commands alone. Later, the pace picks up, and strategic advice is substituted (such as how to partition a disk for maximum speed and reliability) for "type-this" instructions. <p>  Throughout, the book makes effective use of O'Reilly's time-tested and remarkably clear format for presenting Unix commands and configuration files. Each chapter concludes with a series of exercises designed to help you discover behaviors on your own, and includes the practice questions you expect in a test-prep aid. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The knowledge that's tested on the Linux Professional Institute's exams 101 and 102, which includes everything from basic Linux commands and concepts to installation of the operating system, essential network configuration, and kernel recompilation.

review: Like other books in the popular Nutshell series, this one is aimed at powerusers and provides very concise descriptions of topics ranging from desktop basics to using the free developer tools that ship with Mac OS X (through 10.2 a.k.a.  Jaguar) to Unix terminals and shell programming.  Other topics include web publishing with Darwin, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python (DAMP); using CVS, the concurrent versions system, to manage changes to project files; running the X Window System; and text editing with vi and Emacs. Appendices include a 225- page Unix command reference which lists 289 commands with syntax, a description, and a list of available options.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn the tradition of O'Reilly's Nutshell series, this new title offers a thorough treatment of Mac OS X version 10.2, from its BSD Unix foundation to Aqua, the new user interface.  The book's Unix Command Reference is the most complete and thorough coverage of Mac OS X Unix commands you can find anywhere. Each command and option in this section has been painstakingly tested and checked against Jaguar--even the manpages that ship with the system can't compete in accuracy.  The reference incorporates the new command-line tools that come with Apple's Developer tools.  It familiarizes readers with the Finder and the Dock, file management, system configuration, network administration issues, and more.  Later chapters include bonus material for the Unix user, including advanced use of the Terminal and how to configure a DAMP (Darwin, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP) web publishing system. Mac OS X in a Nutshell provides a wealth of knowledge for anyone who wants to make the most of Mac OS X.

review: <I>Understanding the Linux Kernel</I> is intended to be read by those  who are happy to check points off against the source code. The first thing you  learn is how Linux, released from commercial constraints, is able to take  advantage of the best ideas from other systems, implemented in wonderfully  flexible ways. A good example is the Virtual File System (VFS), which has made  it easy to add support for file systems from almost every other OS. It's  fascinating to find out how such features are implemented. Then, there are  loadable modules, I/O, scheduling, multitasking, multiprocessing, interrupts,  spin locks, semaphores, and all of the other goodies that are involved in making  a kernel work.<p>  The authors are concerned primarily with the Linux 2.2 kernel. They discuss how  Linus Torvald's decisions on kernel issues translate into architecture; for  example, how the Linux memory management uses a slab allocator on top of a buddy  system for greater efficiency. Similarly, at the cost of a little complexity,  the decision to use three-level memory paging, when two work fine on 32-bit  systems, makes it possible to port to 64-bit processors without changes. The  tradeoffs between complexity and efficiency are discussed for most kernel  features, and each chapter finishes with related new features in kernel 2.4.<p>  Despite the lucid and knowledgeable writing, you'll come up against some brain-stretching complexity. Nevertheless, this book is an important addition to the  Linux canon. <I>--Steve Patient, Amazon.co.uk</I>

review: Covering Oracle SQL's main features, including the new features of Oracle Database 10g, this guide uses real-world examples to show how to use Oracle to solve specific problems or meet particular needs. The book gives specific attention to Oracle's strengths in the areas of regular expressions, interior calculations, recursive queries, analytic and advanced Group BY functions, and SQL/XML standards.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe vast majority of Oracle SQL books discuss some syntax, provide the barest rudiments of using Oracle SQL, and perhaps include a few simple examples. It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.   Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded Mastering Oracle SQL has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.  Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable.

review: The use of forms on the web is so commonplace that most user interactions involve some type of form. XForms--a combination of XML and forms--offers a powerful alternative to HTML-based forms. By providing excellent XML integration, including XML Schema, XForms allows developers to create flexible, web-based user-input forms for a wide variety of platforms, including desktop computers, handhelds, information appliances, and more.   XForms Essentials is an introduction and practical guide to the new XForms specification.  Written by Micah Dubinko, a member of the W3C XForms working group and an editor of the specification, the book explains the how and why of XForms, showing readers how to take advantage of them without having to write their own code. You'll learn how to integrate XForms with both HTML and XML vocabularies, and how XForms can simplify the connection between client-based user input and server-based processing.   XForms Essentials begins with a general introduction to web forms, including information on history and basic construction of forms. The second part of the book serves as a reference manual to the XForms specification. The third section offers additional hints, guidelines, and techniques for working with XForms.  Topics covered in the book include:	creating XForms files in a text or XML editorconverting existing forms (electronic or paper) to XFormscollecting XML data from users in a user-friendly wayreducing the amount of JavaScript needed within browser interfacesincreasing the security and reliability of your current forms system by combining client-side and server-side checks into a common code basecreating interactive websites using the latest standard technologyXForms Essentials focuses on the practical application of XForms technology. If you work with forms, HTML, or XML information, XForms Essentials will provide you with a much simpler route to more sophisticated interactions with users.

review: Even hot dog Web coders proficient in XML need a little refresher once and a while. Although some portions of XML are still very fluid, the handy <I>XML Pocket Reference</I> offers quick access to the syntax and usage rules of this next-generation language.<p> At the front of the book, a crash course in XML quickly spells out the important terminology, along with extremely short examples of XML, Document Type Definition (DTD), and Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) documents. The book also includes a nice bulleted list of cautions and rules to follow if you want to create valid XML documents. A tip section entitled, "Unlearning Bad Habits" offers handy warnings that are especially useful for those of us who occasionally slip into sloppy HTML coding behaviors that XML won't tolerate.<p> The remainder of the title comprises reference sections devoted to XML, DTDs, XSL, XLink, and XPointer. These sections offer a balanced mix of both straight syntax references and brief general explanations of key topics. Short examples are in abundance to illustrate usage with accompanying explanatory text. The authors are very up-front about the changing nature of the XSL, XLink, and XPointer and point out that even their freshly published material on these subjects may soon be out of date.<p> You won't find any big-picture look at the importance or implementation of XML in the real world. However, if you're already sold on the technology and working with it, this little guide will be a handy companion. <I>--Stephen W Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: XML overview, well-formed XML rules, using elements and attributes, syntax and usage reference to XML, DTD, XSL, XLink, XPointer., XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is the next-generation markup language for the Web. It provides a more structured (and therefore more powerful) medium than HTML, allowing you to define new document types and stylesheets as needed. Although the generic tags of HTML are sufficient for everyday text, XML gives you a way to add rich, well-defined markup to electronic documents.<p>The <i>XML Pocket Reference</i> is both a handy introduction to XML terminology and syntax, and a quick reference to XML instructions, attributes, entities, and datatypes. Although XML itself is complex, its basic concepts are simple. This small book combines a perfect tutorial for learning the basics of XML with a reference to the XML and XSL specifications. The new edition introduces information on XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and Xpath.

review: <P><STRONG>DSP for In-Vehicle and Mobile Systems</STRONG> is focused on digital signal processing strategies for improving information access, command and control, and communications for in-vehicle environments. It is expected that the next generation of human-to-vehicle interfaces will incorporate speech, video/image, and wireless communication modalities to provide more comfortable and safer driving ambiance. It is also expected that vehicles will become "smarter" and provide a level of wireless information sharing of resources regarding road, weather, traffic, and other information that drivers may need immediately or request at a later time while driving on the road. The format of this work centers on three themes: in-vehicle corpora, speech recognition/dialog systems with emphasis on car environments, and digital signal processing for mobile platforms involving noise suppression, image/video processing, and alternative communication scenarios that can be employed for in-vehicle applications.</P> <P><STRONG>DSP for In-Vehicle and Mobile Systems</STRONG> is appropriate for researchers and professionals working in signal processing technologies, next generation vehicle design and networked-communications.</P>

review: In Chapter 6 of <i>Information Architecture for the World Wide  Web</i>, the authors discuss the details of good search-engine design.  In a bitingly humorous segment, they analyze a Web site's search-page  results: "Let's say you're interested in knowing what the New  Jersey sales tax is.... So you go to the State of New Jersey web site  and search on <i>sales tax</i>. The 20 results are scored at either 84%  or 82% relevant. Why does each document receive only one of two  scores?... And what the heck makes a document 2% more relevant than  another?" <P> With a swift and convincing stroke, the authors of  <i>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</i> tear down many  entrenched ideas about Web design. Flashy animations are cool, they  agree, as long as they don't aggravate the viewer. Nifty clickable  icons are nice, but are their meanings universal? Is the search engine  providing results that are useful and relevant? This book acts as a  mirror and with careful questioning causes the reader to think through  all the elements and decisions required for well-crafted Web design.  <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I>

review: Oracle8i, the long-awaited Internet database from Oracle Corporation, has hit the streets running--and you may find yourself struggling to keep up with Oracle's fast-moving technology. Oracle boasts that Oracle8i offers more than 150 new features, many of them designed to make its popular database programming language, PL/SQL, faster, more powerful, and easier to use.  This concise and engaging book is both a companion to Oracle PL/SQL Programming (widely recognized as the bible for PL/SQL developers) and  a guide designed to bring you up to speed as quickly as possible on the  new PL/SQL features of Oracle8i. Following the style of Feuerstein's earlier  books, the Guide to Oracle8i Features combines easy-to-understand  descriptions of the new Oracle8i features with a wealth of interesting  and informative examples. It covers autonomous transactions, invoker  rights, native dynamic SQL, bulk binds and collects, system-level  database triggers, new built-in packages, fine-grained access control,  calling Java methods from within PL/SQL, and much more.   Some PL/SQL developers are uneasy about what the introduction of Java means to their applications--and their programming future. But the two languages are expected to work well together in Oracle8i. This book gives you enough Java know-how to build simple Java classes, load them into the Oracle8i database, and leverage those  classes from within your PL/SQL code. Now you'll be able to take advantage of all the power of Java without giving up the performance  and usability advantages of PL/SQL!  Included with this book is a diskette providing point-and-click access to approximately 100 files of reusable source code and examples.Book InfoDesigned to bring you up to speed on the new PL/SQL features of Oracle8i.  Combines easy-tounderstand descriptions of the new Oracle8i features with a wealth of interesting and informative examples.  Softcover.  CD-ROM included.

review: The thing about Perl 6 is: It's a work in progress. However, the end product--which may not be out for a couple of years--will represent such a foundation shift in the state of the Perl art that it's a good idea to keep up with advances in the development process as they occur. <I>Perl 6 Essentials</I>, which is intended to be reissued several times during Perl 6 development, aims to keep working Perl users informed of architectural decisions, feature additions, syntactic changes, and community developments as they occur. The idea is that if you keep up with the <I>Perl 6 Essentials</I> series, you'll be ready to go when the final release appears--if you're not inspired to join the development effort first.<p>  A jaded software developer, having seen too many insubstantial "advance" books rushed to press just so they can be the only books available on their topic for a while, might be suspicious of this book. Such suspicion is not borne out by the contents of <I>Perl 6 Essentials</I>, which are valuable. Though thin, this book is dense with information and well worth its modest cover price. The authors clearly explain what's new (so far) in Perl 6, and do an excellent job of explaining the new Parrot virtual machine architecture. There's extensive coverage of Parrot assembly language (PASM), more than enough for you to do some significant exploratory programming with it. The authors have a good sense of what Perl developers want to know about their future working environment, and satisfy that demand. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: The state of the Perl 6 development effort through Apocalypse 6 (a development milestone) and the Parrot virtual machine through version 0.0.10. The most valuable coverage is of Parrot and its assembly language (PASM). Changes in Perl features and syntax get lots of attention, as well.

review: America is just waking up to the vast potential of the wireless Web. In Japan, nearly a third of the population already works, plays, and shops with wireless, continuously connected to a universe of data, services, and communities. The force responsible is a young company with a name that means "anywhere" in Japanese: DoCoMo. Another case study that examines a specific corporation for management lessons it can share with others, <I>DoCoMo--Japan's Wireless Tsunami</I> takes a riveting look at the world&#146;s second-largest mobile phone service that has, after only two years, a customer base as big as AOL&#146;s. Don&#146;t think of this book as an apology for the languishing telecom industry. Instead, it&#146;s an inside look at how creativity and innovation were nurtured at one of the world&#146;s stodgiest companies--Nippon Telephone and Telegraph--and how a small team of committed visionaries never said "Never" and created DoCoMo&#146;s extraordinarily popular I-mode technology.<p>  For those who've read of the importance of "intrapreneurship" in corporations, here is a real-life exploration of that principle in action. Noted business strategists John Beck (<I>The Attention Economy</I>) and Mitchell Wade give us story upon story of the dynamic personalities behind I-mode, from NTT Chairman Kouji Ohboshi--who saw DoCoMo through a series of crises that would have meant early death for most U.S. startups--to CEO Keiji Tachikawa, whose post-WWII childhood gave him a keen grasp of the economics of disparity.<p>  With chapter headings like "People-People Who Need People" and "Passion Is Destiny," this book sends the strong message that every successful business model depends so heavily on the human factor--a point that seems lost in the venture-capital-dominated model of the West. With lessons for all business leaders, in any industry, this book stands as a testament to the pivotal role of conviction, integrity, and personal passion in business success. <I>--Charles Decker</I>

review: This book consists of many short, focused topic features that answer all the typical questions newcomers ask, such as how does this work? how do I do it? without losing the reader or a sense of humor. Duntemann explains the complex security issues clearly, and shows how users can protect themselves from both obvious and non-obvious threats. He expands the blizzard of WiFi acronyms and touches on the human element in the WiFi movement, including hacker threats and WiFi weirdness. The unique FAQ-index feature allows readers to zero in on precisely what they need to know without plowing through unrelated text. Many technical figures clarify difficult concepts, with abundant Web pointers to further information.From the PublisherWe are really pleased to be publishing this expertly written hands-on guide by legendary tech writer, Jeff Duntemann. Jeff's real passion over the last decade has been anything wireless (he&#146;s been a radio ham for 30 years) and he brings an expertise to the table in writing this book that you likely will not find in any other book. As an engaging and entertaining writer and speaker, Jeff has a knack for making formidable technology fun and easy to understand. As part of his Drive-By Wi-Fi guide, Jeff passionately:  * Explains what Wi-Fi is and why it&#146;s ideal for use in the home, especially in conjunction with high-speed Internet connections.  * Puts the much-publicized drive-by hacker threat into perspective, and explains how such hackers may be kept out of your wireless network.  * Shows you how to combine loose parts of stuff you likely have sitting around the house to enhance your Wi-Fi network.  * Shows you how you can save many hours of time and money putting your Wi-Fi network together.  The Wi-Fi industry is really confusing with so many standards (802.11 this and 802.11 that) but Jeff really knows his stuff and he easily cuts through all of the confusion to bring you a guide that is certain to become the bible for all Wi-Fi users. Wi-Fi is a goofy business. Unlike a lot of technologies, corporate America isn&#146;t driving the wireless networking field. Ordinary people are&#151;along with a lot of wild-eyed hobbyists. Jeff&#146;s book really reflects the trends that are taking place in the Wi-Fi industry.  Soup box antennas, chicken-wire power boosters, Boingo connections and the dreaded AirSnort&#151;it&#146;s all here! Jeff treats the subject with an easy touch and a light heart, and speaks the language of ordinary people rather than computer geeks. The presentation focuses on the human element more than technology jargon, with all the strange stories and oddball characters that have made Wi-Fi a culture of its own within the larger culture of personal computing.

review: This pocket reference provides quick-reference information  that will help you use Oracle Corporation's extensive set of built-in functions and packages, including those new to Oracle8.  Oracle's PL/SQL language is a programming language providing  procedural extensions to the SQL relational database language  and to an ever-growing number of Oracle development tools.  Among the most useful constructs in the PL/SQL language are the built-in functions and packages.   Built-in functions are constructs that operate on certain  types of data (e.g., numeric, character) to return a result. By using functions, you can minimize the coding you need to do in your programs. Functions are described in detail in  Steven Feuerstein's Oracle PL/SQL Programming; this comprehensive guide to building applications with PL/SQL has  become the bible for PL/SQL developers who have raved about its  completeness, readability, and practicality.   Built-in functions fall into several major categories:  Character functions: Operate on character data. Examples include  CONCAT (concatenates two strings into one), LENGTH (returns the length  of a string), and REPLACE (replaces a character sequence in a string  with a different set of characters).Date functions: Operate on dates and supplement the DATE datatype. Examples include SYSDATE (returns the current date and time in the Oracle Server) and LAST_DAY (returns the last day in the month of the specified date).Numeric functions: Operate on numeric data. Examples include CEIL  (returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified  number) and POWER (returns a number raised to a particular power).LOB functions: Operate on large object data. Examples include EMPTY_BLOB (returns an empty locator of the binary large object type) and EMPTY_CLOB (returns an empty locator of the character large object type).Conversion functions: Perform explicit conversions of different types of data. Examples include TO_CHAR (converts a number or date  to a string) and TO_NUMBER (converts a string to a number).Miscellaneous functions. Examples include GREATEST (returns the greatest of the specified list of values) and UID (returns the user ID of the current Oracle session).  Built-in packages (collections of PL/SQL objects, such as functions, procedures, and data structures) greatly expand the scope of the PL/SQL language. These packages are described in detail in Feuerstein's  and Beresniewicz's book, Oracle Built-in Packages. Built-in  packages are built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of the built-ins is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for Web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself.   Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. For example:DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code.DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory. DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs.  The book shows how to call all of the commonly used built-in functions and packages. For packages, it also shows the RESTRICT REFERENCES pragmas (needed if you call packages from a SQL statement), as well as the exceptions, constants, and data structures defined in the packages.Book InfoProvides quick-reference information that will help you use Oracle's extensive set of PL/SQL built-in functions & packages, including those new to Oracle8.

review: The stable, adaptable Unix underpinnings of Mac OS X surely have contributed to the operating system's fantastic success in the market. The trouble for the Mac loyal, though, is that nothing could be further removed from the friendly Mac user interface than the Unix shell environment. There's a learning curve to be surmounted by Mac users who want to get the most out of their new System, and that's where <I>Learning Unix for Mac OS X Panther</I> comes into the picture. It's an introductory Unix and shell-scripting text tailored to the specificities of Mac OS X, suitable for someone who's never worked with Unix before.<p>  Because the capabilities of the Unix shell are vast, the authors devote many pages to showing how key commands (like ls and chmod) work in the most commonly encounter scenarios. More usefully (because Unix help screens explain the basics pretty well by themselves), they carefully explain a lot of recipes that solve problems everyone encounters--like the fact that Unix and many Mac applications encode the line breaks in text files differently. The authors' style consistently succeeds in communicating both facts about Unix and a sense of adventure about what you can do with it. This is a real treasure for anyone wanting to get the most out of the latest Mac OS. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use the Unix operating system that underlies Mac OS X. Specifically, the authors show how to manage files, edit text with pico and vi, print text and graphics, and connect to the Internet. Special coverage shows how to explore the large assortment of open-source software suited to the Mac.

review: As one of the applications in Microsoft Office, Word is the dominant word-processing program for both Windows and Mac users. Millions of people around the globe use it. But many, if not most, of them barely skim the surface of what is possible with Microsoft Word. Seduced by the application's supposed simplicity, they settle for just what's obvious--even if it doesn't satisfy their wants and needs. They may curse the wretched Bullets and Numbering buttons multiple times a day or take hours to change the font size of every heading in a lengthy report, yet they're reluctant to dig deeper to take advantage of Word's immense capabilities and limitless customization tools.   Let Word Hacks be your shovel. Let it carve your way into Word and make this most popular and powerful application do precisely what you want it to do. Filled with insider tips, tools, tricks, and hacks, this book will turn you into the power user you always wanted to be. Far beyond a tutorial, Word Hacks assumes you have a solid working knowledge of the application and focuses on showing you exactly how to accomplish your pressing tasks, address your frequent annoyances, and solve even your most complex problems.  Author Andrew Savikas examines Word's advanced (and often hidden) features and delivers clever, time-saving hacks on taming document bloat, customization, complex search and replace, Tables of Contents and indexes, importing and exporting files, tables and comments, and even using Google as a dictionary! With him as your guide, you'll soon be understanding--and hacking--Word in ways you never thought possible.  Covering Word 2000, 2002 and Word 2003, Word Hacks exposes the inner workings of Word and releases your inner hacker; with it, you will be equipped to take advantage of the application s staggering array of advanced features that were once found only in page layout programs and graphics software and turning Word into your personal productivity powerhouse.

review: Explains the interconnected and far-ranging world of TeX software, mostly public domain with some commercial, that gives TeX its power and flexibility. The software includes macro packages and format files, fonts, picture and figure macros, and a host of utilities including drivers, previewers, printing programs, online documentation facilities, graphics programs, and more. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.Book DescriptionTeX is a powerful tool for creating professional quality typeset text and is unsurpassed at typesetting mathematical equations, scientific text, and multiple languages. Many books describe how you use TeX to  construct sentences, paragraphs, and chapters. Until now, no book has described all the software that actually lets you build, run, and use TeX to best advantage on your platform. Because creating a TeX document requires the use of many tools, this lack of information is a serious problem for TeX users.  TeX is increasing in popularity, and the need for information is becoming more critical. Many technical journals now request that articles be submitted in TeX. TeX is also playing an increasing role  in the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) environment. TeX's  portability and flexibility -- not to mention the fact that it is  free -- are also making it the typesetting tool of choice for interchange  between hardware and software platforms and for international exchange.  Yet, despite this growing interest in TeX, TeX users everywhere are  having to reinvent the wheel by wrestling with TeX's many tools and  files on their own.  Making TeX Work guides you through the maze of tools available  in the overall TeX system. Beyond the core TeX program there are  myriad drivers, macro packages, previewers, printing programs, online  documentation facilities, graphics programs, and more. This book  describes them all. It covers:  How to assemble the software you need to build and install     TeX on all common platforms: UNIX, DOS, Macintosh, and VMS.How to get TeX and its associated tools from public domain     and commercial sources (a complete buyer's guide).How to select and use the tools that let you incorporate     graphics into your documents and create bibliographies,     indices, and other complex document elements.How to install and use fonts to best advantage, including     PostScript and TrueType fonts and LaTeX's New Font Selection     Scheme (NFSS).

review: Two of Sun Solaris's prime attractions are its reliability and the high availability of servers running it. These advantages can be, however, negated by carelessness. Forget to apply a patch, or neglect to synchronize your servers' system clocks, and someone who's paying more attention will exploit the holes you've left in your system. The authors of <I>Hack Proofing Sun Solaris 8</I> teach you how to run Solaris with flair. They show you how to implement wise security rules and implement popular services--like Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts--with a focus on improving security without reducing function. Most of the advice here has to do with Solaris boxes as Web servers, mail servers, and firewalls.<p>A lot of the authors' advice will be familiar to readers who have done security work before--their advice to disable all nonessential services, for example, falls into this category. Other information, such as the particular syntax of Solaris's native security utilities and third-party programs that are designed for Solaris, is very handy. It'll prove especially nice for people coming to Solaris from security administration on other operating systems. The organizational approach balances quick reference--the ability to quickly locate some detail via the index--with informative background that will help you head off emerging, undocumented attacks. There aren't many earth-shaking revelations in this book, but it contains good documentation of Solaris security tools and procedures. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Sun Solaris 8 defensive policies and procedures. Native Solaris tools (like audit log) are documented, as are outside tools like Snort. There's advice on setting user and file permissions, and hints on how to configure network services like HTTP, SMTP, DHCP, and network address translation (NAT) in a secure way. Caching with Squid gets attention, too.

review: This book is written for system administrators who need to know how to keep their systems secure from unauthorized use. The anonymous author takes a hacker's view of various systems, focusing on how the system can be cracked and how you can secure the vulnerable areas.<p> The book makes it clear from the outset that you cannot rely on commercial software for security. Some of it is flawed, and even the best of it has to be used correctly to provide even the most basic security measures. The author scrutinizes such operating systems as Microsoft Windows, Unix, Novell, and Macintosh. He details many of the tools crackers use to attack the system, including several that have legitimate uses for system administration. Rather than merely cataloging areas of risk and showing how various flaws can be exploited, the author makes every effort to show how security holes can be avoided and remedied. <I>Maximum Security</I> tells you which software to avoid and then details which security tools are invaluable, providing the URLs necessary to acquire them. An enclosed CD-ROM provides links to many of the tools and resources discussed in the book. The CD-ROM also leads you to several online documents where you can learn more about Internet security in general and specifics for securing your own site. <I>--Elizabeth Lewis</I>

review: Written with experienced Web authors in mind, <i>Creating Shockwave Web Pages</i> provides in-depth advice on how to use Shockwave, the add-in for Macromedia's Director, Authorware, FreeHand, and Audio. The authors cover each of these products, but most of the discussion relates to Director 5 and its programming language, Lingo. You get detailed help on creating basic animations, adding interactivity, and creating Lingo-driven Shockwave files that sort and display lists of data such as corporate directories. <P> There's also a lot of information on Internet Lingo for Shockwave, which consists of new Internet-related Lingo commands for such tasks as navigating through Web pages and downloading Internet files. What's more, you get advice on creating a coherent Web site with a storyboard, backgrounds, Shockwave movies, and other multimedia elements such as Animated GIFs, Java Applets, Real Audio, and video files. The last few chapters discuss Shockwave for Audio, Authorware, and Freehand, and provide a reference of the test projects used in the book. A CD-ROM includes Shockwave; demo versions of Director, FreeHand, and Authorware; a gallery of Shockwave files with original code; and graphics utilities.

review: ColdFusion has enjoyed widespread use among developers as a powerful, easy-to-learn platform for creating and deploying dynamic web applications.  ColdFusion's simple, tag-based language makes it easy to handle basic tasks, like processing form data and querying databases, but the language is also powerful enough to deliver highly scalable, robust applications.  And now that Macromedia has integrated ColdFusion into its MX family of technologies, ColdFusion is capable of interacting with Flash MX applications, which opens up even more possibilities.  The first edition of this book has been praised as the best reference book available on the subject.  This new edition, Programming ColdFusion MX, 2nd Edition, goes even further, documenting new techniques for using ColdFusion MX 6.1 to develop and serve dynamic web page content.  This exhaustive guide covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, with numerous examples that you can use for your own applications.

review: With distributions for both Unix and 32-bit Windows environments, the Apache Web server boasts reliability, security, and scalability--and it's free. <I>Apache: The Definitive Guide</I> shows Apache administrators how to perform their jobs, detailing the server through version 1.3.<p> The authors--one of them a member of the Apache development team--begin with an academic discussion of what Web servers do before walking the reader through the process of installing Apache. Installation gets much attention--readers find out, step by step, how to set up a Web site (or several) under Apache, and how to set up Web site security and other preferences properly. The book also provides in-depth discussions of particular aspects of Apache operation, including MIME handling, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), and security features such as authentication and caching.<p> For the programmers in the crowd, this book documents the Apache API with discussions of resource pools and their allocation, plus a full API reference. A tutorial explains how to write Apache extension modules in C. In all matters, <I>Apache: The Definitive Guide</I> covers both Unix and Win32 machines, but it places more emphasis on the Unix port. The complete source code of Apache 1.3 appears on the CD-ROM that ships with the book. <I>--David Wall</I>

review: TiVo Hacks helps you get the most out of your TiVo personal video recorder. Armed with just a screwdriver and basic understanding of PC hardware (or willingness to learn), preeminent hackability awaits. This book includes hacks for changing the order of recorded programs, activating the 30-second skip to blaze through commercials, upgrading TiVo's hard drive for more hours of recording, use of TiVo's Home Media Option to remotely schedule a recording via the Web, log in to the serial port for command-line access to programming data, log files, closed-captioning data, display graphics on the TiVo screen, and even play MP3s. While TiVo gives viewers personalized control of their TVs, TiVo Hacks gives users personalized control of TiVo.   Note: Not all TiVos are the same. The original TiVo, the Series 1, is the most hackable TiVo out there; it's a box thrown together with commodity parts and the TiVo code is running on open hardware. The Series 2 TiVo, the most commonly sold TiVo today, is not open. You won't see hacks in this book that involve modifying Series 2 software.

review: Because they're so complicated, many books on relational databases are either burdensomely academic (<I>Database Management Systems</I> is the classic example of this mode--it's superb, but one practically needs a professor to help you decode it) or so practical-minded as to be overly simple. <I>Designing Relational Database Systems</I> has struck an attractive balance between the two extremes by providing enough theory to enable you to design your databases intelligently, while keeping in mind real-world business practices and the practical limitations of actual database management systems. <p>Author Rebecca Riordan emphasizes Microsoft database products to a small degree, using Microsoft Access and the Jet engine in some of her examples. The Microsoft overtones aren't overpowering, by any means. <p> Riordan is an excellent writer, communicating complex details about database design clearly, referring to reinforcements (in the form of arrow-linked tables or conceptual flow diagrams) with great effect. She also uses anecdotal information--stories about getting customers to explain exactly what they want from a database system, for example--to communicate lots of practical advice to the reader. This book would be better with more information on platform-independent user interface design--which is key in publicly accessible Web databases--but that's a minor fault. Read this book if you want to be a more capable database architect. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: The theory and practice of designing relational databases and their management systems. The author explains tables and their relationships, queries, business logic, database schema, and interface design.

review: No matter how flexible and convenient digital information has become, we haven't done away with the need to see information in print.  Extensible Style Language-Formatting Objects, or XSL-FO, is a set of tools developers and web designers use to describe page printouts of their XML (including XHTML) documents.  If you need to produce high quality printed material from your XML documents, then XSL-FO provides the bridge. 	XSL-FO is one of the few books to go beyond a basic introduction to the technology. While many books touch on XSL-FO in their treatment of XSLT, this book offers in-depth coverage of XSL-FO's features and strengths. Author Dave Pawson is well known in the XSLT and XSL-FO communities, and maintains the XSLT FAQ.  An online version of this book has helped many developers master this technology. XSL-FO is the first time this reference is available in print.  The first part of the book provides an overview of the technology and introduces the XSL-FO vocabulary. The author discusses how to choose among today's implementations, explains how to describe pages, and shows you what is going on in the processor in terms of layout.  You'll learn about the basics of formatting and layout as well as readability.  The second part focuses on smaller pieces: blocks, inline structures, graphics, color and character level formatting, concluding by showing how to integrate these parts into a coherent whole. XSL-FO also explores organizational aspects you'll need to consider?how to design your stylesheets strategically rather than letting them evolve on their own.  XSL-FO is more than just a guide to the technology; the book teaches you how to think about the formatting of your documents and guides you through the questions you'll need to ask to ensure that your printed documents meet the same high standards as your computer-generated content.  Written for experienced XML developers and web designers, no other book contains as much useful information on this practical technology.

review: <HTML>Real Linux users don't use GUIs.  No matter how popular, slick and sophisticated the interfaces become for Linux and UNIX, you'll always need to be able to navigate in a text editor.  The vi editor is the original standard UNIX full screen editor.  It's been around almost since UNIX began and it has changed very little.  To get around the limitations of vi the people at Bram Moolenaar created the vim editor (the name stand for VI iMproved).  It contains many more features than the old vi editor including: help, multiple windows, syntax highlighting, programmer support, and HTML support.  All of the books published to date focus on vi alone not the expanded vim shipping with every major Linux distribution.  In true New Riders' form, the vim reference will be a definitive, concise reference for the professional Linux user and developer.  This tutorial takes a task oriented approach allowing you to learn only the commands that make your job easier.</HTML>

review: Referring to specific information inside an XML document is a little like finding a needle in a haystack: how do you differentiate the information you need from everything else?  XPath and XPointer are two closely related languages that play a key role in XML processing by allowing developers to find these needles and manipulate embedded information.  XPath describes a route for finding specific items by defining a path through the hierarchy of an XML document, abstracting only the information that's relevant for identifying the data.  XPointer extends XPath to identify more complex parts of documents.  The two technologies are critical for developers seeking needles in haystacks in various types of processing.    <i>XPath and XPointer</i> fills an essential need for XML developers by focusing directly on a critical topic that has been covered only briefly.  Written by John Simpson, an author with considerable XML experience, the book offers practical knowledge of the two languages that underpin XML, XSLT and XLink. <i>XPath and XPointer</i> cuts through basic theory and provides real-world examples that you can use right away.      Written for XML and XSLT developers and anyone else who needs to address information in XML documents, the book assumes a working knowledge of XML and XSLT.  It begins with an introduction to XPath basics.  You'll learn about location steps and paths, XPath functions and numeric operators.  Once you've covered XPath in depth, you'll move on to XPointer--its background, syntax, and forms of addressing.  By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to construct a full XPointer (one that uses an XPath location path to address document content) and completely understand both the XPath and XPointer features it uses.      <i>XPath and XPointer</i> contains material on the forthcoming XPath 2.0 spec and EXSLT extensions, as well as versions 1.0 of both XPath and XPointer.  A succinct but thorough hands-on guide, no other book on the market provides comprehensive information on these two key XML technologies in one place.

review: <I>Perl in a Nutshell</I> strives to be a perfect set of socket tools for the active Perl programmer. By and large, it succeeds, providing endless and well-thought-out lists and tables on the language's modules, flags, and extensions. The authors briefly address basic learner's questions--such as the difference between a hash and an array--but these concepts are not the purpose of the book. (Those new to Perl would be better off with others in the O'Reilly Perl series, such as <I>Learning Perl</I>, while programmers making the switch to Perl can pick up the nuances of the language with <I>Programming Perl</I>.) This book is pure Perl reference, briefly covering Perl/Tk (for GUI Perl programs on Unix and Windows 95/NT) and Perl for Win 32.<p> The authors do start at the very beginning, and even in a self-described "desktop quick reference" find the time to comment on less urgent--but still interesting--Perl-related matters (like how to find online help amidst the "Perl culture"). The format of the book makes sections on topics such as Perl debugging easily understandable, illustrating how to make an interactive and timesaving environment.<p> Of particular convenience is the outstanding section on the standard Perl modules. A four-page "quick look" allows you to easily scan through short definitions of all the modules and find the entry you're looking for. An index with full definitions for each module follows, showing you how to use each module and providing a more in-depth explanation (and often, examples). <I>Perl in a Nutshell</I> concludes--as you might expect--with an excellent and well-cross-referenced index. <I>--Jennifer Buckendorff</I>

review: Despite their myriad manifestations and different targets, nearly all attacks on computer systems have one fundamental cause: the code used to run far too many systems today is not secure. Flaws in its design, implementation, testing, and operations allow attackers all-too-easy access.  Secure Coding, by Mark G. Graff and Ken vanWyk, looks at the problem of bad code in a new way. Packed with advice based on the authors' decades of experience in the computer security field, this concise and highly readable book explains why so much code today is filled with vulnerabilities, and tells readers what they must do to avoid writing code that can be exploited by attackers.  Beyond the technical, Secure Coding  sheds new light on the economic, psychological, and sheer practical reasons why security vulnerabilities are so ubiquitous today. It presents a new way of thinking about these vulnerabilities and ways that developers can compensate for the factors that have produced such unsecured software in the past. It issues a challenge to all those concerned about computer security to finally make a commitment to building code the right way.

review: Java Data Objects revolutionizes the way Java developers interact with databases and other datastores.  JDO allows you to store and retrieve objects in a way that's natural to Java programmers.  Instead of working with JDBC or EJB's container-managed persistence, you work directly with your Java objects. You don't have to copy data to and from database tables or issue SELECTs to perform queries: your JDO implementation takes care of persistence behind-the-scenes, and you make queries based on the fields of your Java objects, using normal Java syntax.  This book, written by the JDO Specification Lead and one of the key contributors to the JDO Specification, is the definitive work on the JDO API.  It gives you a thorough introduction to JDO, starting with a simple application that demonstrates many of JDO's capabilities.  It shows you how to make classes persistent, how JDO maps persistent classes to the database, how to configure JDO at runtime, how to perform transactions, and how to make queries.  More advanced chapters cover optional features such as nontransactional access and optimistic transactions.  The book concludes by discussing the use of JDO in web applications and J2EE environments.  Whether you only want to read up on an interesting new technology, or are seriously considering an alternative to JDBC or EJB CMP, you'll find that this book is essential.  It provides by far the most authoritative and complete coverage available.

review: This thorough guide explains how to harness the power of Java to create distributed systems, which the author defines as a group of "agents" working together across multiple systems.<p>In order to create distributed applications, Java programmers need to be familiar with a host of technologies and language features in Java. These include Java's networking capabilities, its threading model, CORBA, Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and the JDBC standard for connecting to databases. <I>Java Distributed Computing</I> is a step-by-step guide to all of these pieces of the puzzle, presented in a concise, usable format.<p>The author presents each topic in digestible increments with some illustrative Java code, including a distributed game of chess, a chat application, and a whiteboard application. Advanced chapters cover security issues and dealing with "limited bandwidth" applications (such as pagers or Web browsers). Useful appendices list the fundamentals of CORBA, RMI, and JavaSpaces to make it easy for the working developer to look them up. <i>--Richard Dragan</i>

review: The 3rd edition of the well-known reference, <I>Java in a Nutshell</I>, covers the essential APIs of Java 1.2, including networking, security, input and output, and basic language and utility classes. Due to the size of the Java 1.2 API, graphics and graphical user interface classes are now examined in a volume called <I>Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell</I>, and server-side and enterprise programming are detailed in <I>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</I>. <p> Though primarily a reference, the book starts off with a thorough, fast-paced introduction to Java, exploring all the key topics, including syntax, object-oriented programming, security, beans, and tools. These discussions are brief and very information-dense, and if you are buying this book to learn the language, you will probably be overwhelmed by the speed of this initiation. <p> This book intends to document quite a bit of Java, and it easily succeeds with broad coverage of Java programming in Part I, and API cataloging broken down by package in Part II. For example, discussions in Part I explain Types, Reflection, and Dynamic Loading. The handling of these topics takes a little over a page, but the book gives a useful overview with code examples that clearly illustrate the points made. It is one of the clearest and most concise treatments of these three topics available. <p> The chapters in Part II include an introduction, diagrams, and sections for each class in the package. The sections for each class can be very informative, as in the discussion of the Socket class in the java.net chapter, which includes how to instantiate a Socket object, getting I/O streams from the object you instantiated, and how to alter the behavior of sockets. This discussion, like most in this book, is brief, clear, and to the point. <p> If you are looking for a Java reference, this is a solid volume that will provide lasting value. <I>--John Keogh</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Part I, "Introducing Java," provides broad coverage of Java programming topics, including data types, syntax, classes, and objects; Java file structure; inner classes; interfaces; packages; creating and initializing objects; destroying and finalizing objects; input/output; cryptography; networking; security; threads; JavaBeans; JavaDoc; and tools that come with Java 1.2 SDK. <p> Part II, "The Java API Quick Reference," includes chapters on the following Java packages: java.beans, java.beans.beancontext, java.io, java.lang, java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.math, java.net, java.security, java.security.acl, java.security.cert, java.security.interfaces, java.security.spec, java.text, java.util, java.util.jar, java.util.zip, javax.crypto, javax.crypto.interfaces, javax.crypto.spec, and a final chapter, which provides an index for classes, methods, and fields.

review: Focusing on principles rather than syntax, this book overviews the many capabilities and options available in Oracle's middle-tier application server, its basic architecture, and the processes and tools available to manage the server environment. Intended for both developers and database administrators, it describe the HTTP server, application server containers for J2EE (OC4J), Java and XML development, web services, business intelligence components, and the OracleAS portal.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe new Oracle Application Server offers a wide range of functionality, including Java runtime and development tools, portal development tools, business intelligence, single sign-on identify management, and much more.  It's so powerful and complex, in fact, that many people who use the product (or are considering using it) are familiar with only a portion of the entire range of its capabilities. The choices can be overwhelming. Few people grasp how the larger issues--such as the interplay between components or the various architectural choices in the product--play out in the Oracle Application Server.  This new guide provides the perfect introduction to the Oracle Application Server for users of any level.   Regardless of which of the server's capabilities you use, you'll benefit from this tightly focused, all-in-one technical overview. It's written for anyone who is concerned with using and managing web servers, doing Java development and deployment, using Oracle's own tools--like Forms and Reports, using or developing for Oracle Portal, or those who use and administer business intelligence, mobile or integration software.   Divided into three concise sections, the book covers server basics, core components, and server functionality. The book leads with the history of Oracle Application Server, its architecture, management, standards, and third-party support for languages and tools such as Java, Perl, and HTTP.  The next section covers Oracle's web server, containers for Java web caching, and the server's security features. And finally, the book discusses HTML development, Java development, and Oracle development.  Although the book refers mainly to Oracle Application Server 10g, the authors also describe features in earlier product releases where necessary, particularly Oracle9i Application Server.  More comprehensible than a large reference and more detailed than a primer, the book provides a foundation for understanding and using Oracle Application Server effectively and efficiently. Readers concentrate on the most important issues and components of the server, focusing primarily on principles rather than syntax. Designed to be the ideal first OracleAS book, Oracle Application Server 10g Essentials offers Oracle application developers and administrators everything they need to know about this powerful server.

review: Consists of 117 sample solutions for configuring sendmail functions running on a Unix computer that system administrators customize for their specific needs.  The tasks discussed include accepting mail from other hosts, passing outbound mail to a relay, masquerading with LDAP, routing mail to special purpose mailers, blocking spam with the access database, and patching to close security holes.  The examples are based on sendmail 8.12 taken from Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 and Solaris 8.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe sendmail Cookbook provides step-by-step solutions for the administrator who needs to solve configuration problems fast. Each recipe in the sendmail Cookbook outlines a configuration problem, presents the configuration code that solves that problem, and then explains the code in detail. The discussion of the code is critical because it provides the insight you need to tweak the code for your own circumstances.   The sendmail Cookbook begins with an overview of the configuration languages offering a quick how-to for downloading and compiling the sendmail distribution. Next, you'll find a baseline configuration recipe upon which many of the subsequent configurations, or recipes, in the book are based. Recipes in the following chapters stand on their own and offer solutions for properly configuring important sendmail functions. The book also provides lots of new material that doesn't get much coverage elsewhere--STARTTLS and AUTH are given entire chapters, and LDAP is covered in recipes throughout the book.

review: How often have you heard anyone can design a game? While it seems likean easy job, game ideas are cheap and plentiful. Advancing those ideasinto games that people want to play is one of the hardest, and mostunder-appreciated, tasks in the game development cycle. Andrew Rollingsand Ernest Adams on Game Design introduces both students and experienced developers to the craft of designing computer and video games for the retail market. The first half of the book is a detailed analysis of thekey game design elements: examining game concepts and worlds,storytelling, character and user interface design, core mechanics andbalance. The second half discusses each of the major game genres(action, adventure, role-playing, strategy, puzzle, and so on) andidentifies the design patterns and unique creative challenges thatcharacterize them. Filled with examples and worksheets, this book takesan accessible, practical approach to creating fun, innovative, andhighly playable games.From the PublisherAndrew and Ernest have compiled a wonderful book for both potential and experienced gamers alike. The best part about this book is the worksheets that appear in almost all the chapters. They enable you to stop and consider various game design questions even before starting your own design &#150; questions such as What process is the player going to manage? What actions will the player take in managing that process? and Who is the central character in the game, the player&#146;s avatar?    Here's what Will Wright (creator of The Sims and SimCity) says about the book: A very useful book for anyone working in (or hoping to work in) interactive media. Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams approach the topic with very practical advice for both new and experienced designers.  We hope you like it, too. Please send me your thoughts.

review: Functional genomics--the deconstruction of the genome to determine the biological function of genes and gene interactions--is one of the most fruitful new areas of biology. The growing use of DNA microarrays allows researchers to assess the expression of tens of thousands of genes at a time. This quantitative change has led to qualitative progress in our ability to understand regulatory processes at the cellular level.  This book provides a systematic introduction to the use of DNA microarrays as an investigative tool for functional genomics. The presentation is appropriate for readers from biology or bioinformatics. After presenting a framework for the design of microarray-driven functional genomics experiments, the book discusses the foundations for analyzing microarray data sets, genomic data-mining, the creation of standardized nomenclature and data models, clinical applications of functional genomics research, and the future of functional genomics.Book InfoProvides a systematic introduction to the use of CNA microarrays as an investigative tool for functional genomics.

review: International information security experts contribute to a text that the editor acknowledges may soon be obsolete. Ten chapters address four areas: the state of the art (from US and New Zealand viewpoints); managing Intranet and Internet security (building trust and effective information security policies are key); cryptography methods and standards; and security and the law (again from Uncle Sam and kiwi perspectives). Janczewski is in management science and information systems at the U. of Auckland, New Zealand. Other contributors hail from the US, Germany, and Cambodia.Book News, Inc.&#174, Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn the last 12 years we have observed amazing growth of electronic communication. From typical local networks through country-wide systems and business-based distributed processing, we have witnessed widespread implementation of computer-controlled transmissions encompassing almost every aspect of our business and private lives.  Internet and Intranet Security Management: Risks and Solutions addresses issues of information security from the managerial, global point of view. The global approach allows us to concentrate on issues that could be influenced by activities happening on opposite sides of the earth.

review: Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules offers a gentle but thorough introduction to advanced programming in Perl.  Written by the authors of the best-selling Learning Perl, this book picks up where that book left off. Topics include:Packages and namespacesReferences and scopingManipulating complex data structuresObject-oriented programmingWriting and using modulesContributing to CPANFollowing the successful format of Learning Perl, each chapter in the book is designed to be small enough to be read in just an hour or two, ending with a series of exercises to help you practice what you've learned. To use the book, you just need to be familiar with the material in Learning Perl and have ambition to go further.   Perl is a different language to different people.  It is a quick scripting tool for some, and a fully-featured object-oriented language for others.  It is used for everything from performing quick global replacements on text files, to crunching huge, complex sets of scientific data that take weeks to process.  Perl is what you make of it.  But regardless of what you use Perl for, this book helps you do it more effectively, efficiently, and elegantly.

review: <I>Web Caching</I> explores the intricacies of implementing caching in Web server environments to reduce network traffic and improve performance. Like so many areas of Internet technology, the topic of Web caching comprises a number of architectural and practical issues that could take a career to learn the hard way. Fortunately, author Duane Wessels has organized all the nuts-and-bolts technical information in this short book.<p>  This guide to turbo-charging the Web is primarily geared toward system administrators; however, Web developers can also learn much about the proper--and improper--use of caching their pages. The book begins with excellent chapters on the big picture of how Web caching works, including the various types of caches, hit measurements, validation, and cache refreshing. Before turning to this guide's core focus--designing and implementing caching--the author spends a chapter to explore the political issues surrounding the technology, such as privacy, content distribution, and copyrights.<p>  Both client and server configurations are considered, and the benefits of Netscape and Microsoft implementations are explored. The journey through the efficient travels of Web requests is fascinating as you learn about proxies, intercache protocols, cache hierarchies, and benchmarking methodologies for measuring the efficiency of your solutions. Dishing up requests elegantly is not a trivial task on today's Web, but this no-nonsense book is a great help toward that goal. <I>--Stephen W.

review: Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from random number generators to floating point operations and other optimized arithmetic algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously written, this book (and series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work of authoritative scholarship in classical computer science, but one that can be read and used profitably by virtually all working programmers.<p> The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some knowledge of calculus.<p> Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable for college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's library.

review: It's big, it contains a fair amount of extraneous material, and some of its contents are out of date, but many parts of <I>Java Unleashed</I> are clear, informative, and useful to the programmer who wants to add Java to his or her tool kit. If you're willing to do some sifting--and particularly if you have some C or C++ experience--this book will satisfy you.<p>  Starting with the usual "Hello, World" application, the authors explain the fundamentals of the Java language--universal stuff that won't change much as different versions of the language come out. They cover variables, operators, control structures, classes, packages, and the rest of the stuff you need to understand in order to make things happen. Later chapters take on more complicated subjects, like threads, exceptions, applets, and the special considerations involved in programming for a networked environment.  <p>  Pleasantly, the authors chose to include a section on JavaScript, a much simpler language that programmers can use to write interfaces for Java applets. Unfortunately, there's no coverage of LiveConnect, which is the scheme by which JavaScript and Java communicate. <p>  <I>Java Unleashed</I> suffers from the usual faults of huge, multiauthor books, including disparities among the authors' writing styles and some short chapters on huge subjects (like VRML). Further, this book centers on Java 1.0, which isn't awful--browsers support Java 1.0 with stability--but it's hardly cutting-edge. A companion CD-ROM boasts Sun's JDK 1.0 and Symantec's Visual Caf&eacute; Lite, as well as some plug-ins and editing tools.  <I>--David Wall</I>

review: Dramatically updating and extending the first edition, published in 1995, the second edition of <i>The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks</i> presents the enormous progress made in recent years in the many subfields related to the two great questions: How does the brain work? and, How can we build intelligent machines?<br /> <br /> Once again, the heart of the book is a set of almost 300 articles covering the whole spectrum of topics in brain theory and neural networks. The first two parts of the book, prepared by Michael Arbib, are designed to help readers orient themselves in this wealth of material. Part I provides general background on brain modeling and on both biological and artificial neural networks. Part II consists of "Road Maps" to help readers steer through articles in part III on specific topics of interest. The articles in part III are written so as to be accessible to readers of diverse backgrounds. They are cross-referenced and provide lists of pointers to Road Maps, background material, and related reading.<br /> <br /> The second edition greatly increases the coverage of models of fundamental neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, and neural network approaches to language. It contains 287 articles, compared to the 266 in the first edition. Articles on topics from the first edition have been updated by the original authors or written anew by new authors, and there are 106 articles on new topics.

review: JavaServer Pages (JSP) has built a huge following since the release of JSP 1.0 in 1999, providing Enterprise Java developers with a flexible tool for development of dynamic web sites and web applications. While point releases over the years, along with the introduction of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), have incrementally improved the rough areas of the first version of the JSP specification, JSP 2.0 takes this technology to new heights.   JavaServer Pages, Third Edition, is completely revised and updated to cover the JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 specifications. It includes detailed coverage of the Expression Language (EL) incorporated into JSP 2.0, the JSTL 1.1 tag libraries and the new function library, the new tag file format that enables custom tag library development without Java code, the simplified Java tag library API, improvements in the JSP XML syntax, and more. Further, it details setup of the Apache Tomcat server, JSP and JSTL syntax and features, error handling and debugging, authentication and personalization, database access, XML processing, and internationalization.   This book recognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals who want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP elements in web pages and programmers concerned with learning the JSP API and using JSP effectively as a part of an enterprise application. If you're in the first group, you learn from the practical web application examples in the second part of the book. If you re in the latter group, you appreciate the detailed coverage of advanced topics in the third part, such as integrating servlets and JavaBeans components with JSP using the popular Apache Struts MVC framework, and how to develop custom tag libraries using the JSP API, with realistic examples you can use as a springboard for your own libraries.

review: Written for web developers who want to share their site with others or use the content other people are syndicating, this book overviews the most commonly used XML syndication standard, RDF site summary (RSS), which allows a portal to display headlines and URLs from other sites all within the same page. Hammersly, who is a British journalist, explains how to create an RSS feed, how to use RSS 1.0 modules, how to incorporate other RSS 0.9x feeds within a web site, and how to extend a desktop reader to understand a new module.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionOriginally developed by Netscape in 1999, RSS (which can stand for RDF Site Summary, Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format that allows web developers to describe and syndicate web site content. Content Syndication with RSS offers webloggers, developers, and the programmers who support them a thorough explanation of syndication in general and RSS in particular. Written for web developers who want to offer XML-based feeds of their content, as well as developers who want to use the content that other people are syndicating, the book explores and explains metadata interpretation, different forms of content syndication, and the increasing use of web services in this field.   Topics covered in the book include:Creating XML syndication feeds with RSS 0.9x and 2.0Beyond headlines: creating richer feeds with RSS 1.0 and RDF metadataUsing feeds to enrich a site or find informationPublish and subscribe: intelligent updatingNews aggregators, such as Meerkat, Syndic8, and Newsisfree, and their web servicesAlternative industry-centric standardsIf you're interested in producing your own RSS feed, this step-by-step guide to implementation is the book you'll want in hand.

review: <p> This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language and its many powerful but scantily documented modules. This comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the most frequently needed information--not just about the Python language itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library and the most important third-party extensions. </p> <p> Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers have it all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable and maintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with components in C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standard library and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy to learn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming challenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise and clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance in how best to use Python's great power. <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> fills this need. </p> <p> <i>Python in a Nutshell</i>, Second Edition covers more than the language itself; it also deals with the most frequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular and important third party extensions. Revised and expanded for Python 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's new subprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's new IronPython project. Our "Nutshell" format fits Python perfectly by presenting the highlights of the most important modules and functions in its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practical programming needs. This book includes: </p> <ul>   <li>A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language</li>   <li>An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python </li>   <li>Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules, packages, strings, and regular expressions</li>   <li>A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functions and key modules </li>   <li>Reference material on important third-party extensions, such as Numeric and Tkinter</li>   <li>Information about extending and embedding Python </li> </ul> <p><i>Python in a Nutshell</i> provides a solid, no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the most. This book will immediately earn its place in any Python programmer's library. </p> Praise for the First Edition:<br> <p> "In a nutshell, <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> serves one primary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Python language. True, you can get most of the same core information that is presented within the covers of this volume online, but this will invariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lacking the examples or the exact syntax description necessary to truly understand a command."<br> --Richard Cobbett, <i>Linux Format</i><br> </p> <p> "O'Reilly has several good books, of which <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving you some idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it."<br> --Jerry Pournelle, <i>Byte Magazine</i></p>

review: Soon after its launch, Ant succeeded in taking the Java world by storm, becoming the most widely used tool for building applications in Java environments. Like most popular technologies, Ant quickly went through a series of early revision cycles.  With each new version, more functionality was added, and more complexity was introduced. Ant evolved from a simple-to-learn build tool into a full-fledged testing and deployment environment.  Ant: The Definitive Guide has been reworked, revised and expanded upon to reflect this evolution.  It documents the new ways that Ant is being applied, as well as the array of optional tasks that Ant supports.  In fact, this new second edition covers everything about this extraordinary  build management  tool from downloading and installing, to using Ant to test code.  Here are just of a few of the features you'll find detailed in this comprehensive, must-have guide:Developing conditional builds, and handling error conditionsAutomatically retrieving source code from version control systemsUsing Ant with XML filesUsing Ant with JavaServer Pages to build Web applicationsUsing Ant with Enterprise JavaBeans to build enterprise applicationsFar exceeding its predecessor in terms of information and detail, Ant: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition is a must-have for Java developers unfamiliar with the latest advancements in Ant technology.  With this book at your side, you'll soon be up to speed on the premiere tool for cross-platform development.

review: Linux consistently turns up high in the list of popular Internet servers, whether it's for the Web, anonymous FTP, or general services like DNS and routing mail. But security is uppermost on the mind of anyone providing such a service. Any server experiences casual probe attempts dozens of time a day, and serious break-in attempts with some frequency as well.  As the cost of broadband and other high-speed Internet connectivity has gone down, and its availability has increased, more Linux users are providing or considering providing Internet services such as HTTP, Anonymous FTP, etc., to the world at large.  At the same time, some important, powerful, and popular Open Source tools have emerged and rapidly matured--some of which rival expensive commercial equivalents--making Linux a particularly appropriate platform for providing secure Internet services.   Building Secure Servers with Linux will help you master the principles of reliable system and network security by combining practical advice with a firm knowledge of the technical tools needed to ensure security.  The book focuses on the most common use of Linux--as a hub offering services to an organization or the larger Internet--and shows readers how to harden their hosts against attacks.  Author Mick Bauer, a security consultant, network architect, and lead author of the popular Paranoid Penguin column in Linux Journal, carefully outlines the security risks, defines precautions that can minimize those risks, and offers recipes for robust security. The book does not cover firewalls, but covers the more common situation where an organization protects its hub using other systems as firewalls, often proprietary firewalls.  The book includes:Precise directions for securing common services, including the Web, mail, DNS, and file transfer.Ancillary tasks, such as hardening Linux, using SSH and certificates for tunneling, and using iptables for firewalling.Basic installation of intrusion detection tools.Writing for Linux users with little security expertise, the author explains security concepts and techniques in clear language, beginning with the fundamentals.  Building Secure Servers with Linux provides a unique balance of big picture principles that transcend specific software packages and version numbers, and very clear procedures on securing some of those software packages.  An all-inclusive resource for Linux users who wish to harden their systems, the book covers general security as well as key services such as DNS, the Apache Web server, mail, file transfer, and secure shell.  With this book in hand, you'll have everything you need to ensure robust security of your Linux system. From the AuthorIn response to Reviewer: Charles Dallas from Boise, Idaho.  While a few of the many tools covered in my book do have X11 interfaces, these constitute a very small percentage of software packages my book covers. Furthermore, where applicable I do explain how to run them from the command line. Obviously, installing X11 on any server should be avoided, and my book states this repeatedly.

review: Certain cities--Singapore is one example--have begun to outfit gathering places like airport lounges and downtown coffee shops as "hot spots" that are served by wireless Internet antennas. It's possible for anyone with an IEEE 802.11b card in a laptop to sit down in one and have Internet access immediately. The author of <I>Building Wireless Community Networks</I>, Rob Flickenger, thinks this is a great idea. He's written this small, thin volume to explain to readers why wireless networking is a community asset, and to bring them up to speed on the technologies available for creating wireless hot spots. <i>Community</i> here means a collection of people, as in a town or neighborhood.<p>  Wireless networking protocols are complicated, but IEEE 802.11b and the products that have sprung up around it (like Apple's AirPort and similar offerings from Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems) are pretty easy to set up and integrate into a network. Flickenger's treatment deals with these admirably but places more emphasis on configuring operating systems (notably Linux) to work as wireless gateways for transient users. The really fun reading has to do with custom antennas, though. Flickenger explains--no kidding--how to convert a Pringles potato-chip can into an antenna for wireless networking and goes into detail on how to work around the challenges posed by topography and human-made obstacles. This is a smart book about one of the most exciting frontiers in computer networking. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Means of delivering wireless network access (mainly Internet access) to rooms, buildings, communities, and whole geographic regions of up to a few miles in diameter. Design and placement of access points, as well as configuration of network nodes, is covered in detail, as are the legal and political aspects of building a wireless network for general community use.

To secure the Internet infrastructure, every developer has to take a security stance - to audit every line of code, to use proper API and write correct and secure code as much as possible.  To achieve this goal, the examples presented in this book are implemented with a security stance.  Also, the book leads you to write secure programs.  For instance, the book recommends against the use of some of the IPv6 standard APIs - unfortunately, there are some IPv6 APIs that are inherently insecure, so the book tries to avoid (and discourage) the use of such APIs.

review: With all the material available in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and soft computing-texts, monographs, and journal articles-there remains a serious gap in the literature. Until now, there has been no comprehensive resource accessible to a broad audience yet containing a depth and breadth of information that enables the reader to fully understand and readily apply AI and soft computing concepts.Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing fills this gap. It presents both the traditional and the modern aspects of AI and soft computing in a clear, insightful, and highly comprehensive style. It provides an in-depth analysis of mathematical models and algorithms and demonstrates their applications in real world problems. Beginning with the behavioral perspective of human cognition, the text covers the tools and techniques required for its intelligent realization on machines. The author addresses the classical aspects-search, symbolic logic, planning, and machine learning-in detail and includes the latest research in these areas. He introduces the modern aspects of soft computing from first principles and discusses them in a manner that enables a beginner to grasp the subject. He also covers a number of other leading aspects of AI research, including nonmonotonic and spatio-temporal reasoning, knowledge acquisition, and much more. Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing: Behavioral and Cognitive Modeling of the Human Brain is unique for its diverse content, clear presentation, and overall completeness. It provides a practical, detailed introduction that will prove valuable to computer science practitioners and students as well as to researchers migrating to the subject from other disciplines.Book InfoPresents both the traditional and the modern aspects of AI and soft computing in a clear, insightful, and highly comprehensive style.

review: In a Linux cluster, multiple computers are able to work together as a team by sharing a local area network. This guide for cluster administrators covers issues ranging from initial hardware and software choices through long-term considerations such as performance. The focus is on clustering for high performance computation, although much of the information presented also applies to clustering for high-availability (failover and disaster recovery). All of the freely available, open source software described has been selected for its usefulness to new cluster administrators and programmers.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionTo the outside world, a supercomputer appears to be a single system. In fact, it's a cluster of computers that share a local area network and have the ability to work together on a single problem as a team. Many businesses used to consider supercomputing beyond the reach of their budgets, but new Linux applications have made high-performance clusters more affordable than ever. These days, the promise of low-cost supercomputing is one of the main reasons many businesses choose Linux over other operating systems.   This new guide covers everything a newcomer to clustering will need to plan, build, and deploy a high-performance Linux cluster. The book focuses on clustering for high-performance computation, although much of its information also applies to clustering for high-availability (failover and disaster recovery). The book discusses the key tools you'll need to get started, including good practices to use while exploring the tools and growing a system. You'll learn about planning, hardware choices, bulk installation of Linux on multiple systems, and other basic considerations. Then, you'll learn about software options that can save you hours--or even weeks--of deployment time.  Since a wide variety of options exist in each area of clustering software, the author discusses the pros and cons of the major free software projects and chooses those that are most likely to be helpful to new cluster administrators and programmers. A few of the projects introduced in the book include:MPI, the most popular programming library for clusters. This book offers simple but realistic introductory examples along with some pointers for advanced use.OSCAR and Rocks, two comprehensive installation and administrative systemsopenMosix (a convenient tool for distributing jobs), Linux kernel extensions that migrate processes transparently for load balancingPVFS, one of the parallel filesystems that make clustering I/O easierC3, a set of commands for administering multiple systemsGanglia, OpenPBS, and cloning tools (Kickstart, SIS and G4U) are also covered. The book looks at cluster installation packages (OSCAR & Rocks) and then considers the core packages individually for greater depth or for folks wishing to do a custom installation.  Guidelines for debugging, profiling, performance tuning, and managing jobs from multiple users round out this immensely useful book.

review: This book provides everything you would expect, but little more; however, <I>Linux Configuration & Installation</I> provides it so authoritatively that there's no doubt about completeness or accuracy. Because one of the authors, Patrick Volkerding, created Slackware Linux, this documentation of his own Linux flavor is good.<p> The authors begin by helping you decide if your machine's hardware will cooperate with Linux. They then show you how to install Slackware Linux 3.2 and get it to recognize your hardware. The authors detail how to install XFree86 (X Windows for Linux) and give more customization advice than most other authors of Linux books do. Other chapter topics include managing files; applications, such as elvis and a vi port for Linux; system administration; and Internet services. While these chapters aren't command references, they do show users how to get into the proper frame of mind for doing things with Slackware Linux and impart some command facts along the way.<p> The best features of this book are its two CD-ROMs. Not only do they contain Slackware Linux 3.2, ready to install, but also XFree86, lots of hardware drivers, a bunch of compilers, and some games and miscellaneous utilities. You'll play with this stuff for days.

review: In the vast and varied universe of computer books, only a few stand out  as the best in their subject areas. <I>Building Internet Firewalls</I> is one of  those. It's deep, yet carefully focused, so that almost anything you might want  to know about firewall strategies for protecting networks is here. In addition,  there's lots of information on the reasons that we build firewalls in the first  place, which is to say the security risks that come with Internet connectivity.  You'll learn a great deal about Internet services and the protocols that provide  them as you follow this book's recommendations for stifling attacks. <p>  If there's a shortcoming to this book, it's its lack of coverage of the turnkey  firewall products that are becoming popular among home and small-office users.  Emphasis here is on more complicated network defenses that require careful  design and setup--both design and implementation are the order of the day here.  The authors carefully enumerate the threats they see in various situations, go  into some detail on how those threats manifest themselves, and explain what  configuration changes you can make to your perimeter defenses to repulse those  threats. Plenty of illustrations make points about good and bad security  strategies (you want to put the routers <I>here</I> and <I>here</I>, not  <I>here</I> or <I>here</I>). You'll learn a lot by reading this book from cover  to cover, no matter how much experience you have. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Means of protecting private networks from external  security threats. The authors go into detail on attackers' means of exploiting  security holes in common Internet services, and show how to plug those holes or  at least limit the damage that can be done through them. With coverage of Unix,  Linux, and Windows NT, the authors detail their philosophies of firewall design  and general security policy.

review: O'Reilly has done it again! This is my favorite book yet on writing CGI scripts with Perl (5.0). The extensive use of real world applications you can try while learning, and the great examples of how to have CGI interact with databases are especially useful. I suspect I shall order several copies for some of our staff who are new to CGI. Although the book has a UNIX bias, it has much to offer scripters on all platforms. <P> Note that many competitors cram a CD-ROM into their books to give greater "shelf appeal".  Don't be fooled. O'Reilly continues its economically and ecologically sensible approach of pointing you to their FTP site to obtain the example code used in the book. (Thanks, Tim!) Highly Recommended.

review: Schwartz (clinical decision making, University of Illinois) clarifies the installation, configuration, and use of the SpamAssassin's rule-based system that analyzes email and compares different parts of messages with a large set of rules. Writing with Unix system administrators in mind, he also explains how to integrate SpamAssassin with the sendmail, Postfix, qmail, and Exim mail transport agents.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe annoyance factor for individual users whose email is crammed with pitches for pornography, absurd moneymaking schemes, and dubious health products is fierce. But for organizations, the cost of spam in lost productivity and burned bandwidth is astronomical. While society is grappling with a solution to the burgeoning crisis of spam proliferation, the pressure is on system administrators to find a solution to this massive problem in-house. And fast.   Sys admins can field scores of complaints and spend months testing software suites that turn out to be too aggressive, too passive, or too complicated to setup only to discover that SpamAssassin (SA), the leading open source spam-fighting tool, is free, flexible, powerful,  highly-regarded, and remarkably effective. The drawback?  SpamAssassin's lack of published documentation.   SpamAssassin by Alan Schwartz, is the only published resource devoted to SpamAssassin and how to integrate it effectively into your networks. This clear, concise guide clarifies the installation, configuration, and use of the SpamAssassin spam-checking system (versions 2.63 and 3.0) for Unix system administrators using the Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, or qmail mail servers, helping administrators make the right integration decision for their particular environments.  It covers concrete advice on how to:Customize SpamAssassin's rules, and even create new ones Train SpamAssassin's Bayesian classifier, a statistical engine for detecting spam, to optimize it for the sort of email that you typically receiveBlock specific addresses, hosts, and domains using third-party blacklists like the one maintained by Spamcop.net.Whitelist known good sources of email, so that messages from clients, coworkers, and friends aren't inadvertently lost.Configure SpamAssassin to work with newer spam-filtering methods such as Hashcash (www.hashcash.org) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF).Sys admins, network administrators, and ISPs pay for spam with hours of experimentation and tedious junk email management, frayed user tempers, and their sanity. SpamAssassin, together with this essential book, give you the tools you need to take back your organization's inboxes.  Detailed, accurate and informative--recommended for spam-filtering beginners and experts alike. --Justin Mason, SpamAssassin development team

review: In this guide for system administrators, network engineer Martin describes the various technologies and techniques needed to design, build, and manage a multiprotocol local or wide area network. A sampling of topics includes TCP/IP, AppleTalk, IPX, NetBIOS, LAN and WAN internetworking technologies, network switches, Cisco routers, dynamic routing protocols, and network troubleshooting.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe growing dependence of enterprise networks on Internet connectivity is forcing professional system and network administrators to turn to technologies that they may not fully understand for solutions.  This book will provide those connectivity solutions, delivering both an understanding of technology fundamentals and their practical applications.  Written for beginning to intermediate network professionals, this book will give readers a framework to assess the requirements and problems of their particular environment, and the information and know-how to build the optimal network for that environment.  The content of the book provides the necessary balance between the basics and the practical examples needed to distinguish this book from other professional networking book offerings.

review: Covering versions 7 and 8.1, this guide discusses the WebLogic server and management console, with specific instructions concerning topics like J2EE web applications, servlet engine management, EJB construction and deployment, SSL, security, registry, the web service framework, logging, and internationalization APIs. The guide is intended for developers, programmers, administrators, and system architects.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionBEA's WebLogic Server implements the full range of J2EE technologies, and includes many additional features such as advanced management, clustering, and web services. Widely adopted, it forms the core of the WebLogic platform, providing a stable framework for building scalable, highly available, and secure applications. In fact, in the long list of WebLogic's strengths and features, only one shortcoming stands out: the documentation that comes with the WebLogic server often leaves users clamoring for more information.   WebLogic: The Definitive Guide presents a 360-degree view of the world of WebLogic. Providing in-depth coverage of the WebLogic server, the book takes the concept of definitive to a whole new level. Exhaustive treatment of the WebLogic server and management console answers any question that developers or administrators might think to ask. Developers will find a useful guide through the world of WebLogic to help them apply their J2EE expertise to build and manage applications. Administrators will discover all they need to manage a WebLogic-based setup. And system architects will appreciate the detailed analysis of the different system architectures supported by WebLogic, the overall organization of a WebLogic domain and supporting network infrastructure, and more.   WebLogic: The Definitive Guide is divided into three sections that explore WebLogic and J2EE, Managing the WebLogic Environment, and WebLogic Enterprise APIs. Some of the topics covered in this comprehensive volume include:   Building web applications on the WebLogic Server   Building and optimizing RMI applications   Using EJBs with WebLogic, including CMP entity beans   Packaging and deploying applications   Understanding WebLogic's support for clustering   Performance tuning and related configuration settings   Configuring WebLogic's SSL support   Maximizing WebLogic's security features   Building web services with XML   Using WebLogic's JMX services and MBeans  Anyone who has struggled with mastering the WebLogic server will appreciate the thorough, clearly written explanations and examples in this book. WebLogic: The Definitive Guide is the definitive documentation for this popular J2EE application server.

review: The long-overdue second edition of O'Reilly's <I>Linux Network  Administrator's Guide</I>, by Olaf Kirch and Terry Dawson, still sports the  cowboy colophon, suggesting that netadmins have retained their Lone Ranger  personas. While life for a sysadmin has improved over the years with the  introduction of the ./Configure utility and build-less rpm distributions,  network building and maintenance is still a vast prairie, in its complexity  growing faster than the availability of tools and documentation to tame it.  Linux document libraries are filled with disparate, obsolete, and/or redundant  How-Tos for multiple Ethernet cards, bridging, cable modems, DHCP, Samba, ISDN,  DSL, and laptop Ethernet card peculiarities. <p>  Sadly, the recycling of the cowboy motif indicates a deeper problem with the  second edition. While authors Kirch and Dawson have expanded and updated Kirch's  original text, they give scant attention to any of the paradigm shifts that have  occurred in Linux networking since 1993. Strangely, the authors have retained  much material on core technologies of diminishing importance in the era of small  ISP-connected networks. While PPP and Chat are still relevant for ISP  connections, such protocols as UUCP, SLIP, dip, and PLIP are largely of  historical interest. Discussions of packet routing are not browsable, and there  is no practical presentation of the configuration of routing for multiple  Ethernet cards, which the small-network Linux market needs. The showstopper is  the absence of any discussion of configuring DHCP, DSL, cable modems, or Samba.  When the authors blithely indicate in their preface the growing importance of  these areas, one gathers that this book was written in 1997 or earlier.<p>  Still, in the nearly 500 pages of earnest effort, Kirch and Dawson expand on  such infrastructural basics as TCP/IP, NIS, and DNS. Discussions of firewalls  and IP masquerading are genuinely new, and the authors include an up-to-date  section featuring firewall implementations in kernels as recent as 2.4. Such  tried-and-true utilities as SMTP and Sendmail are covered in detail, although  out-of-the-box implementations haven't posed serious problems for years. The  five chapters on reading and serving network news are positively excessive.<p>  Perhaps it's time for the cowboy to come back to the ranch to see how the world  has changed. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: Standards, argues Jeffrey Zeldman in <I>Designing With Web Standards</I>, are our only hope for breaking out of the endless cycle of testing that plagues designers hoping to support all possible clients. In this book, he explains how designers can best use standards--primarily XHTML and CSS, plus ECMAScript and the standard Document Object Model (DOM)--to increase their personal productivity and maximize the availability of their creations. Zeldman's approach is detailed, authoritative, and rich with historical context, as he is quick to explain how features of standards evolved. It's a fantastic education that any design professional will appreciate.<p>  Zeldman is an idealist who devotes some of his book to explaining how much easier life would be if browser developers would just support standards properly (he's done a lot toward this goal in real life, as well). He is also a pragmatist, who recognizes that browsers implement standards differently (or partially, or not at all) and that it is the job of the Web designer to make pages work anyway. Thus, his book includes lots of explicit and tightly focused tips (with code) that have to do with bamboozling non-compliant browsers into behaving as they should, without tripping up more compliant browsers. There's lots of coverage of design and testing tools that can aid in the creation of good-looking, standards-abiding documents. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Why Web standards (such as XHTML, CSS, ECMAScript, and DOM) are good for everyone, and why site designers and browser makers should move towards standards compliance.

review: While computers and other devices identify each other on networks or the Internet by using unique addresses made up of numbers, humans rely on the Domain Name System (DNS), the distributed database that allows us to identify machines by name. DNS does the work of translating domain names into numerical IP addresses, routing mail to its proper destination, and many other services, so that users require little or no knowledge of the system. If you're a network or system administrator, however, configuring, implementing, and maintaining DNS zones can be a formidable challenge. And now, with Windows Server 2003, an understanding of the workings of DNS is even more critical.   DNS on Windows Server 20003 is a special Windows-oriented edition of the classic DNS and BIND, newly updated to document the many changes to DNS, large and small, found in Windows Server 2003. Veteran O'Reilly authors, Cricket Liu, Matt Larson, and Robbie Allen explain the whole system in terms of the new Windows Server 2003, from starting and stopping a DNS service to establishing an organization's namespace in the global hierarchy.   Besides covering general issues like installing, setting up, and maintaining the server, DNS on Windows Server 2003 tackles the many issues specific to the new Windows environment, including the use of the dnscmd program to manage the Microsoft DNS Server from the command line and development using the WMI DNS provider to manage the name server programmatically. The book also documents new features of the Microsoft DNS Server in Windows Server 2003, including conditional forwarding and zone storage in Active Directory (AD) application partitions.   DNS on Windows Server 2003 provides grounding in:   Security issues   System tuning   Caching   Zone change notification   Troubleshooting   Planning for growth  If you're a Windows administrator, DNS on Windows Server 2003 is the operations manual you need for working with DNS every day. If you're a Windows user who simply wants to take the mystery out of the Internet, this book is a readable introduction to the Internet's architecture and inner workings.

review: <I>Stealing the Network</I> is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature film.<p>  One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well short of cyberpunk classics like <I>Burning Chrome</I> and <I>Snow Crash</I>. Its value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers, OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps). The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems (or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network). Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to these stories of packetized adventure. <I>--David Wall</I>

review: This magnificent tour de force presents a comprehensive overview of a wide variety of algorithms and the analysis of them. Now in its third edition, <I>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume I: Fundamental Algorithms</I> contains substantial revisions by the author and includes numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks, queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures. Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example) and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will study with pleasure.

Although you don't need to know a single bit about Perl to begin reading this book, we do recommend that you already have familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, subroutines, and arrays, and the all-important 'editing a source code file with your favorite text editor.'

review: This guide describes the features of the make tool for automating the mundane aspects of transforming source code into an executable, and explains how to use them for large projects, portability, and debugging. Last published in 1991 as Managing projects with Make; the third edition focuses on the GNU version of make and is largely new material.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe utility simply known as make is one of the most enduring features of both Unix and other operating systems. First invented in the 1970s, make still turns up to this day as the central engine in most programming projects; it even builds the Linux kernel. In the third edition of the classic Managing Projects with GNU make, readers will learn why this utility continues to hold its top position in project build software, despite many younger competitors.  The premise behind make is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, make checks timestamps to see what has changed and rebuilds just what you need, without wasting time rebuilding other files. But on top of this simple principle, make layers a rich collection of options that lets you manipulate multiple directories, build different versions of programs for different platforms, and customize your builds in other ways.  This edition focuses on the GNU version of make, which has deservedly become the industry standard. GNU make contains powerful extensions that are explored in this book. It is also popular because it is free software and provides a version for almost every platform, including a version for Microsoft Windows as part of the free Cygwin project. Managing Projects with GNU make, 3rd Edition  provides guidelines on meeting the needs of large, modern projects. Also added are a number of interesting advanced topics such as portability, parallelism, and use with Java.  Robert Mecklenburg, author of the third edition, has used make for decades with a variety of platforms and languages. In this book he zealously lays forth how to get your builds to be as efficient as possible, reduce maintenance, avoid errors, and thoroughly understand what make is doing. Chapters on C++ and Java provide makefile entries optimized for projects in those languages. The author even includes a discussion of the makefile used to build the book.

review: Everyone loves Google, and it's the first place many people turn to locate information on the Internet. There's a big gap, though, between knowing that you can use Google to get advance information on your blind date and having a handle on the considerable roster of fact-finding tools that the site makes available. <I>Google Hacks</I> reveals--and documents in considerable detail--a large collection of Google capabilities that many readers won't have even been aware of. Want to find the best price on a pair of leg warmers? Try the Froogle price-searcher that's hidden within the Google site. Interested in finding weblog commentary about a particular subject? Tara Calishain and Rael Dornfest call your attention to the special Google syntaxes for that purpose. This book makes it clear that there's lots more to the Google site than typing in a few keywords and trusting the search engine to yield useful results.<p>  If you're a programmer--or even just familiar with a HTML or a scripting language--Google opens up even further. A large part of <I>Google Hacks</I> concerns itself with the Google API (the collection of capabilities that Google exposes for use by software) and other programmers' resources. For example, the authors include a simple Perl application that queries the Google engine with terms specified by the user. They also document XooMLe, which delivers Google results in XML form. In brief, this is the best compendium of Google's lesser-known capabilities available anywhere, including the Google site itself. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to get the most from the Google search engine by using its Web-accessible features (including product searches, image searches, news searches, and newsgroup searches) and the large collection of desktop-resident toolbars available, as well as its advanced search syntax. Other sections have to do with programming with the Google API and simple "scrapes" of results pages, while further coverage addresses how to get your Web page to feature prominently in Google keyword searches.

review: <P>The unprecedented growth in the range of multimedia services offered today by modern telecommunication systems, is possible because of the advancements in signal processing technologies and algorithms. <STRONG>Signal Processing for Telecommunications and Multimedia</STRONG> presents a group of invited contributions, some of which have been based on the papers presented at the 7th International Symposium on DSP for Communication Systems held in Coolangatta on the Gold Coast, Australia, in December 2003. Part I of the book deals with applications of signal processing to transform what we hear or see to the form that is most suitable for transmission or storage for a future retrieval. The first three chapters in this section are devoted to processing of speech and other audio signals. The next two chapters consider image coding and compression, while the last chapter of this part describes classification of video sequences in the MPEG domain.</P>

review: Intended for developers and advanced Office users, this book introduces the new XML capabilities added to the 2003 release of the Office suite, and explains how to create XML documents and templates in WordprocessingML and Excel's SpreadsheetML. It also presents XSLT scripts for WordprocessingML, describes the web services toolkit, and walks through two InfoPath solutions for collecting data.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn Microsoft's Office 2003, users experience the merger of the power of the classic Office suite of applications with the fluidity of data exchange inherent in XML. With XML at its heart, the new version of Microsoft's desktop suite liberates the information stored in millions of documents created with Office software over the past fifteen years, making it available to a wide variety of programs.   Office 2003 XML offers an in-depth exploration of the relationship between XML and Office 2003, examining how the various products in the Office suite both produce and consume XML.  Developers will learn how they can connect Microsoft Office to others systems, while power users will learn to create and analyze XML documents using familiar Office tools.   The book begins with an overview of the XML features included in the various Office 2003 components, and explores in detail how Word, Excel, and Access interact with XML. This book covers both the user interface side, creating interfaces so that users can comfortably (and even unknowingly) work with XML, and the back end, exposing Office information to other processes. It also looks at Microsoft's new InfoPath application and how it fits with the rest of Office. Finally, the book's appendices introduce various XML technologies that may be useful in working with Office, including XSLT, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG, and SOAP. Office 2003 XML provides quick and clear guidance to a anyone who needs to import or export information from Office documents into other systems. Both XML programmers and Office power will learn how to get the most from this powerful new intersection between Office 2003 and XML.

review: <I>Windows 2000 Commands Pocket Reference</I> fully documents the Windows 2000 console interface (that is, the complete set of command-line instructions the operating system understands). With coverage of Windows 2000 in its out-of-the-box form as well as of the operating system with the <I>Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit</I> installed, this book will prove invaluable to system administrators writing batch files to automate work. It also will please those power users and administrators wishing to learn how to do work faster than Windows 2000's graphical user interface (GUI) will allow. <p>  This book represents the first published foray into Windows 2000 by &AElig;leen Frisch, whose work on <I>Essential Windows NT System Administration</I> is highly regarded. Frisch doesn't disappoint, having apparently put into this tiny booklet the same care and attention to accuracy that characterizes her work on Windows 2000's predecessor. With a glance at any command's entry (the entries appear in alphabetical order), the reader can determine what the command is for, what its generic syntax is, what each option and argument means, and whether the command works only with the resource kit installed. Future editions will be better if they include statements of function in their indexes in addition to command names (e.g., the task "trace IP path" in addition to the command "tracert"), but what's here is extremely valuable. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> All commands supported by the Windows 2000 console interface (a.k.a. the command line), with and without the resource kit installed. This is unadorned, man-page-style syntax and usage documentation.

review: Prasad (wireless information and multimedia, Aalborg U.) and Muoz (U. of Cantabria) break ground toward fourth-generation mobile communication by introducing mobility in heterogeneous IP networks with both third-generation and wireless local area networks. They overview third-generation networks and standards, and discuss interworking and handover mechanisms between wireless local networks and the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System. The material varies in technical depth, some being accessible to managers, researchers, system designers, and graduate students.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionExplore the present and future trends of WLANs and WPANs with this new, forward-looking resource. You discover the path that these infrastructures are following from a perspective of synergies with 3G systems, and how they will pave the way for future 4G systems. The book presents a thorough overview of 3G networks and standards, and discusses interworking and handover mechanisms between WLANs and UMTS. You learn what performance can be expected from WLANs and WPANs when they support the TCP/IP stack. Several critical issues are examined in depth, including IP routing and mobility, , PHY and MAC layers for the main WLAN specifications, the TCP-UDP/IP protocol stack, and performance of TCP/IP over IEEE 802.11b.  An entire chapter is devoted to the WPAN domain, where a detailed treatment of Bluetooth as well as a second-generation outlook are provided. Moreover, the book explains how the PEP paradigm provides internetworking capabilities between WLANs and WPANs and how it enhances performance over these platforms. This practical resource is designed to help you save time when planning your next generation networks, offering solutions for Internetworking between WLANs and public cellular networks and for improving the performance of these networks when they support IP.

review: Focusing on IP-based network security assessment in a structured and logical way, the methodology presented in this book describes how a determined attacker will scour Internet-based networks in search of vulnerable components and how an administrator can perform exercises to assess a network's weaknesses and formulate countermeasures. A former hacker, the author outlines techniques for assessing web services, remote maintenance services, FTP and database services, Windows networking services, IP VPN services, Unix RPC services, and application-level risks.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThere are hundreds--if not thousands--of techniques used to compromise both Windows and Unix-based systems. Malicious code and new exploit scripts are released on a daily basis, and each evolution becomes more and more sophisticated. Keeping up with the myriad of systems used by hackers in the wild is a formidable task, and scrambling to patch each potential vulnerability or address each new attack one-by-one is a bit like emptying the Atlantic with paper cup.   If you're a network administrator, the pressure is on you to defend your systems from attack. But short of devoting your life to becoming a security expert, what can you do to ensure the safety of your mission critical systems?  Where do you start?   Using the steps laid out by professional security analysts and consultants to identify and assess risks, Network Security Assessment offers an efficient testing model that an administrator can adopt, refine, and reuse to create proactive defensive strategies to protect their systems from the threats that are out there, as well as those still being developed.   This thorough and insightful guide covers offensive technologies by grouping and analyzing them at a higher level--from both an offensive and defensive standpoint--helping administrators design and deploy networks that are immune to offensive exploits, tools, and scripts. Network administrators who need to develop and implement a security assessment program will find everything they're looking for--a proven, expert-tested methodology on which to base their own comprehensive program--in this time-saving new book.

review: The world's most business-critical transactions run on Unix machines, which means the machines running those transactions attract evildoers. Furthermore, a lot of those machines have Internet connections, which means it's always possible that some nefarious remote user will find a way in. The third edition of <I>Practical Unix & Internet Security</I> contains--to an even greater extent than its favorably reputed ancestors--an enormous amount of accumulated wisdom about how to protect Internet-connected Unix machines from intrusion and other forms of attack. This book is fat with practical advice on specific defensive measures (to defeat known attacks) and generally wise policies (to head off as-yet-undiscovered ones).<p>  The authors' approach to Unix security is holistic and clever; they devote as much space to security philosophy as to advice about closing TCP ports and disabling unnecessary services. They also recognize that lots of Unix machines are development platforms, and make many recommendations to consider as you design software. It's rare that you read a page in this carefully compiled book that does not impart some obscure nugget of knowledge, or remind you to implement some important policy. Plus, the authors have a style that reminds their readers that computing is supposed to be about intellectual exercise and fun, an attitude that's absent from too much of the information technology industry lately. Read this book if you use any flavor of Unix in any mission-critical situation. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Security risks (and ways to limit them) under Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Coverage ranges from responsible system administration (including selection of usernames and logins) to intrusion detection, break-in forensics, and log analysis.

review: This book is a superb introduction to Java servlets and their various communications mechanisms. It includes deep and comprehensive coverage of the Java Servlet API, and also of HTTP, non-HTTP socket communications, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and more. Throughout, the authors present excellent illustrative code and go to much effort to explain why things work the way they do.<p> The authors (to their credit) do not assume that Java programmers will be familiar with transport protocols or what really goes on when a Web server operates. They begin by showing how to use servlets to generate static pages, then show how to get servlets to generate customized documents in response to requests from the client side. That alone will satisfy many readers' problems. However, the authors go on to tell how to track sessions with servlets, how to carry out secure transactions, how to get servlet threads to communicate with each other, and more. If it can be done with Java servlets, it's discussed in this book. <I>Java Servlet Programming</I> also includes a reference to the Java Servlet API, version 2. <I>--David Wall</I>

review: Offers a collection of sample Cisco router configurations and scripts to help network engineers select the right routing protocol and configure it in the most efficient way for a network.  The authors identify 300 configurations problems commonly encountered, provide sample code to resolve each problem, and describe how the solution works.  Topics include system administration functions, IP routing, the frame relay WAN protocol, the network time protocol, the simple network management protocol, queuing, logging, and access lists.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionEverybody who has worked with Cisco routers for any length of time has had to ask their friends and co-workers for example router configuration files that show how to solve a common problem.  A good working configuration example can often save huge amounts of time and frustration when implementing a feature that you've never used before.  The Cisco Cookbook gathers hundreds of example router configurations all in one place.  As the name suggests, Cisco Cookbook is organized as a series of recipes. Each recipe begins with a problem statement that describes a common situation that you might face.  After each problem statement is a brief solution that shows a sample router configuration or script that you can use to resolve this particular problem.  A discussion section then describes the solution, how it works, and when you should or should not use it.  The chapters are organized by the feature or protocol discussed.  If you are looking for information on a particular feature such as NAT, NTP or SNMP, you can turn to that chapter and find a variety of related recipes.  Most chapters list basic problems first, and any unusual or complicated situations last.   The Cisco Cookbook will quickly become your go to resource for researching and solving complex router configuration issues, saving you time and making your network more efficient.

review: A great book for beginning programmers who want to learn Perl. Filled with concrete examples and, yes, by using this book you will be able to write good Perl code on your own in 21 days. But no perlson is an island, and there is no single book that covers Perl completely, so we recommend that you also get Programming Perl, which is better at providing the language specifications, and, in fact, was written by the author of Perl.

review: Provides information on the continuing rivalry between Time Division Multiple Access and Code Division Multiple Access for domination in the third generation of mobile communication systems, and illustrates a number of applications of wireless communications. Covers coding and modulation aspects of communication theory, wireless communication, antennas and propagation, and advanced systems and technology. Among the topics are circuit design and signal processing. The applications include wideband alternatives, ATM technology, wireless data services, local loops, and intelligent transport systems. Book News, Inc.&#174;, Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), within a given time  frame a particular user is allowed to transmit within a given time  slot. This technique is used in most of the second-generation digital  mobile communication systems. In Europe the system is known as GSM, in  USA as DAMPS and in Japan as MPT. In Code Division Multiple Access  (CDMA) every user is using a distinct code so that it can occupy the  same frequency bandwidth at the same time with other users and still  can be separated on the basis of low correlation between the codes.  These systems like IS-95 in the USA are also developed and  standardized within the second generation of the mobile communication  systems. CDMA systems within a cellular network can provide higher  capacity and for this reason they become more and more attractive. At  this moment it seems that both TDMA and CDMA remain viable candidates  for application in future systems.   Wireless Communications: TDMA versus CDMA provides enough  information for correct understanding of the arguments in favour of  one or other multiple access technique. The final decision about which  of the two techniques should be employed will depend not only on  technical arguments but also on the amount of new investments needed  and compatibility with previous systems and their infrastructures.    Wireless Communications: TDMA versus CDMA comprises a collection  of specially written contributions from the most prominent specialists  in wireless communications in the world today and presents the major,  up to date, issues in this field. The material is grouped into four  chapters: Communication theory, covering coding and modulation,  Wireless communications, Antenna & Propagation and Advanced  Systems & Technology.   The book describes clearly the issues and presents the information in  such a way that informed decisions about third generation wireless  systems can be taken. It is essential reading for all researchers,  engineers and managers working in the field of Wireless  Communications.

review: Written especially for those readers coming to VB.NET from an earlier version of Visual Basic, <I>VB.NET in a Nutshell</I> offers a quick language tour as well as a nicely thorough reference to all standard VB objects, methods, and properties. Even if you are a raw beginner, this concise reference is really all you need to get onboard with the new version of the world's most popular programming language.<p>   The first sections of this text zero in on what's new and different in VB.NET. From the basics of the language, centering on data types and object-oriented features, this quick-start guide highlights essential language features that every VB.NET programmer needs to know. There's also material here on the underlying .NET framework, from deployment basics (like .NET assemblies) to built-in namespaces. Coverage of delegates and event handling shows how to process events. The substantially different exception handling model of VB.NET is contrasted with the older ways of handling errors.<p>   The heart of this title has to be its reference material (over 400 pages), primarily on the built-in core VB classes in the new .NET version. While there were rumors that VB.NET changed VB completely, this material should reassure you. By providing APIs that resemble older versions, VB programmers still can leverage common string, date, and time and other functions. Every object, method, and property is described, along with sample code, and differences with VB6. A standout here are "gotchas" when using the new APIs compared to VB6. Besides objects and APIs, there is also coverage of language keywords (for logical, looping, and branching statements), too.	<p>   The book closes with several useful reference sections, one of which details all the new features to be found in VB.NET. This is almost a must-read for anyone facing the new VB.NET for the first time. Another appendix here lists VB.NET language APIs. While it's true that you can use many languages with .NET, <I>VB.NET Language in a Nutshell</I> covers the APIs that will give VB.NET its real flavor as a new programming language. Both a quick-start guide and a worthwhile reference to use everyday at your desk, this title is a great way to start using VB.NET in real projects quickly. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>:  <ul> <li>Introduction to VB.NET  <li>Variables and data types (including arrays, collections and parameter, and arguments)  <li>Object-oriented programming in VB.NET (classes, inheritance, polymorphism and overloading)  <li>Overview of the .NET Framework  <li>The Common Language Runtime (CLR)  <li>Managed execution  <li>Assemblies and VB.NET  <li>.NET namespaces (including the system namespace)  <li>Delegates and events  <li>Error handling in VB.NET (including exception handling techniques)  <li>Comprehensive language reference to VB.NET objects  <li>Methods and properties (including sample code, programming tips/gotchas, VB.NET vs. VB6 differences)  <li>Reference to what's new in VB.NET  <li>Language elements and operators in VB.NET  <li>Using the VB.NET command-line compiler  <li>Unsupported VB 6 language elements</li></ul>

review: The OpenGL graphics libraries offer programmers the ability to construct and render remarkably realistic 3-D scenes that can incorporate multiple lighting sources, various types of perspective, and various special effects. The <i>OpenGL Programming Guide</i> is a comprehensive and definitive resource on using the extensive capabilities offered by OpenGL. Beginning with coverage of basic OpenGL objects--points, lines, and polygons--it advances through functions for selecting colors, lighting, reflective properties, texture, atmospheric haze, and more. Basic concepts of 3-D graphics are made accessible with analogies to cameras, and advanced sidebars and appendices go into deep detail about OpenGL., OpenGL is a powerful software interface for graphics hardware that allows graphics programmers to produce high-quality color images of 3D objects. The functions in the OpenGL library enable programmers to build geometric models, view models interactively in 3D space, control color and lighting, manipulate pixels, and perform such tasks as alpha blending, antialiasing, creating atmospheric effects, and texture mapping. <P> <b>The OpenGL Programming Guide, Second Edition</b>, shows how to create graphics programs, many of which highlight features of the latest OpenGL release. Assuming users have a background in C programming, the book discusses the architecture and functions of OpenGL, Version 1.1. <P> The second edition contains the following additions and improvements: coverage of the new features of OpenGL, Version 1.1, including all texturing changes, vertex arrays, polygon offset, and RGBA logical operations the incorporation of the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, GLUT, in all programming examples, an overview of the OpenGL rendering pipeline and state machine, enhanced coverage of polygon tessellation, quadric surfaces, pixel operations, and error handling, more performance tips, a greatly expanded index. <P> The OpenGL Technical Library provides tutorial and reference books for OpenGL. The library enables programmers to gain a practical understanding of OpenGL and show them how to unlock its full potential. <P> The OpenGL Technical Library is developed under the auspices of the Architecture Review Board (ARB), an industry consortium responsible for guiding the evolution of OpenGL and related technologies. The OpenGL ARB is composed of industry leaders such as Digital Equipment Corporation, Evans & Sutherland, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Intergraph, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, and Silicon Graphics.

review: Not a style manual in the tradition of Strunk & White's <I>The Elements of Style</I>, <I>CGI Manual of Style</I> is a task-oriented tutorial that introduces you to writing Perl programs for CGI. Its clear explanations and useful code listings are marred only by the fact that there's no CD-ROM--you'll have to type the programs in by hand (a good way to learn the code).<P> The first chapters tell you about the CGI specification, including all the methods and environment variables. But they go well beyond that, teaching you how programs parse CGI information in order to use it and explaining how to invoke a CGI script from an HTML document. You also get a run-down on how to configure a Web server to run CGI programs--a real plus for novice CGI programmers who are just trying to get their Web site to do something.<P> After the introductory chapters, author Robert McDaniel gets right into explanations of how to make Perl and CGI do your bidding. He covers general-purpose forms (including forms that use cookies), hit counters, database front ends, push/pull applications (especially as they apply to introductory "splash" screens), and discussion forums. McDaniel explains each program piece by piece, so you know what's going on.<P> This book is an excellent CGI and Perl tutorial, which includes instructions on how to create popular CGI applications that aren't dumbed down, yet aren't written entirely in geekspeak. If you have some experience in another programming language and need to do something in CGI, or even if you're a complete novice, this book will work for you.

review: In this revision of Mac OS X for Unix Geeks (2003) recommended by Apple, two longtime Unix users offer guidance in making the most of the behind-the-scenes Unix side of Mac OS X. Appends information on the filesystem and tools.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionWith its rep for being the sort of machine that won't intimidate even the most inexperienced users, what's the appeal of the Mac&reg; for hard-core geeks? The Mac has always been an efficient tool, pleasant to use and customize, and eminently hackable. But now with Mac OS&reg; X's BSD core, many a Unix&reg; developer has found it irresistible. The latest version of Mac OS X, called Panther, makes it even easier for users to delve into the underlying Unix operating system. In fact, you can port Linux&reg; and Unix applications and run them side-by-side with your native Aqua&reg; apps right on the Mac desktop.  Still, even experienced Unix users may find themselves in surprisingly unfamiliar territory as they set out to explore Mac OS X. Even if you know Macs through and through, Mac OS X Panther is unlike earlier Macs, and it's radically different from the Unix you've used before.   Enter Mac OS X Panther for Unix Geeks by Brian Jepson and Ernest E. Rothman, two Unix geeks who found themselves in the same place you are. The new edition of this book is your guide to figuring out the BSD Unix system and Panther-specific components that you may find challenging. This concise book will ease you into the Unix innards of Mac OS X Panther, covering such topics as:A quick overview of the Terminal application, including Terminal alternatives like iTerm and GLtermUnderstanding Open Directory (LDAP) and NetInfoIssues related to using the GNU C Compiler (GCC)Library linking and porting Unix softwareAn overview of Mac OS X Panther's filesystem and startup processesCreating and installing packages using Fink and Darwin PortsBuilding the Darwin kernelUsing the Apple&reg; X11 distribution for  running X Windows&reg; applications on top of Mac OS XThe book wraps up with a quick manpage-style reference to the Missing Manual Pages --commands that come with Mac OS X Panther, although there are no manpages.   If you find yourself disoriented by the new Mac environment, Mac OS X Panther for Unix Geeks will get you acclimated quickly to the foreign new areas of a familiar Unix landscape.

review: Ruby is an increasingly popular, fully object-oriented dynamic programming language, hailed by many practitioners as the finest and most useful language available today.  When Ruby first burst onto the scene in the Western world, the Pragmatic Programmers were there with the definitive reference manual, <i>Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</i>.  Now in its second edition, author Dave Thomas has expanded the famous Pickaxe book with over 200 pages of new content, covering all the new and improved language features of Ruby 1.8 and standard library modules. The Pickaxe contains four major sections: <ul><li>An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby. </li><li>The definitive reference to the language. </li><li>Complete documentation on all built-in classes, modules, and methods </li><li>Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries.</li></ul>  If you enjoyed the First Edition, you'll appreciate the new and expanded content, including: enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Ruby's capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the world-wide web is easy in Ruby, with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed Ruby, templating systems and other web services.  There's even a new chapter on unit testing.  This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so you can dynamically examine and experiment with your running code. "Ruby is a wonderfully powerful and useful language, and whenever I'm working with it this book is at my side" --Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks

review: <blockquote> How to Wrestle Free from an Alligator: 4. If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove (for example, a limb), tap or punch it on the snout. </blockquote><p> Though it's being marketed as a humorous title--after all, it's unlikely you'll be called upon to land a plane, jump from a motorcycle to a moving car, or win a swordfight--the information contained in <I>The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook</I> is all quite sound. Authors Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht consulted numerous experts in their fields (they're cited at the end of the book) to discover how to survive various and sundry awful events. Parachute doesn't open? Your best bet for survival is to hook your arms through the straps of a fellow jumper's chute--and even then you're likely to dislocate both shoulders and break both legs. Car sinking in water? Open the window immediately to equalize pressure, then open the car door and swim to the surface. Buried in an avalanche? Spit on the snow--it will tell you which direction is really up. Then dig as fast as you can. <p>Each survival skill is explained in simple steps with helpful illustrations. Most stress the need to be prepared--both mentally and physically. For example, to escape from quicksand, you will need to lay a pole on the surface of the quicksand, flop on your back atop the pole, and pull your legs out one by one. No pole? No luck. "When walking in quicksand country, carry a stout pole--it will help you get out should you need to."<p> Hopefully you'll never need to know how to build a fire without matches, perform a tracheotomy, or treat a bullet wound.

review: <I>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</I> will allow you to enhance your Apache HTTP server in just about any way you'd like. Overall, it is an excellent book, and it has a lot of good information and terrific examples on everything from "Content Handlers" to customizing the Apache server configuration process.<p> It's quickly apparent that Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern spent valuable time writing this book considering the breadth of their subject and the depth they devote to it. The only downside to the book is that it's kind of hard to explain all of the API functionality without assuming a minimum level of competence from the audience. For that reason, this book might be a bit intimidating to novice programmers, but it really rewards you if you put time into it and tinker with things.<p> The book also works well as a source of ideas and inspiration for when you have to write your own server modules, and I'd recommend it if you want to customize your Apache server or speed up your Perl CGI programs. <I>--Doug Beaver</I>, Apache is the most popular web server on the Internet because it is free, reliable, and extensible. The  availability of the source code and the modular design  of Apache makes it possible to extend web server  functionality through the Apache API.      For the most part, however, the Apache API has only  been available to C programmers, and requires rebuilding the Apache server from source. mod_perl, the popular  Apache module used primarily for enhanced CGI performance,  changed all that by making the Apache API available to Perl programmers. With mod_perl, it becomes simple  to develop Apache modules with Perl and install them  without having to rebuild the web server.    <i>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</i> shows how to extend  web server capabilities regardless of whether  the programming language is Perl or C. The  book explains the design of Apache, mod_perl, and the  Apache API. It then demonstrates how to use them to  perform for tasks like the following:    <ul><li>Rewriting CGI scripts as Apache modules to  vastly improve performance</li>  <LI>Server-side filtering of HTML documents, to embed special markup or code (much like SSI)</li>  <li>Enhancing server log functionality</li>  <li>Converting file formats on the fly</li>  <li>Implementing dynamic navigation bars</li>  <li>Incorporating database access into CGI scripts</li>  <li>Customizing access control and authorization to  block robots or to use an external database for passwords</li>  </ul>    The authors are Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern. Lincoln is the successful author of <i>How to Set Up and Maintain a World Wide web Site</i> and the developer of the widely used Perl CGI.pm  module. Doug is a consultant and the creator of the innovative  mod_perl Apache module.

review: The order in which ActiveX and VBScript appear in this title should be reversed: This book is a solid and detailed tutorial on VBScript and how to use it within an ActiveX browser environment. The authors ease you into the subject with simple projects that introduce VBScript, the ActiveX Control Pad (Microsoft's free visual tool for adding ActiveX controls to Web pages), and basic manipulation of HTML and browser objects through VBScript. With these preliminaries mastered, you move on to a hefty middle section that offers a thorough grounding in VBScript. Detailed chapters cover datatypes, variables, operators, events, string manipulation, functions, loops, and single- and multi-dimensional arrays. The author illustrates the discussion with examples covering many common uses for VBScript, including data validation and manipulation of HTML objects.<P> The final third of the book concentrates on using VBScript with controls, including the HTML Layout Control, and on working with image maps, browser objects, and cookies. Other topics include using third-party controls, converting existing Visual Basic applications to VBScript Web applications, and understanding basic interaction between VBScript and Java applets. The book is handsomely designed, clearly laid out, easy to read, and enriched with useful indexes, including a VBScript reference. The bundled CD-ROM includes all examples from the book, ActiveX Control Pad, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01, trial versions of several HTML authoring tools, and a grab bag of other useful tools.

review: Known for his books on programming Macintosh computers with HyperCard, Danny Goodman  takes on the task of explaining another free, easy-to-use "volks-language" to the computer community.  Goodman explains everything from how to get set up for JavaScript programming to how to create  complicated programs and includes an outstanding outline-based table of contents that uses frames. He also  includes an excellent sample order form that many business sites will be able to use. All of these goodies  are on the companion CD-ROM.<P> A substantial section of <I>JavaScript Bible</I> is dedicated as a reference to the methods and properties  of all the JavaScript 1.1 objects. The reference also details operators, keywords, and other pieces of  JavaScript syntax. This section is followed by an excellent debugging guide, which includes a list of  JavaScript interpreter error messages with explanations of their meanings. You'll also find a better-than- average discussion of cookies and how to make them do your bidding. This book covers a lot of ground  while avoiding any hint of a lofty, flip, or condescending tone.

review: Ed Bott and Carl Siechert have combined their considerable talents for producing user-level documentation in creating <I>Microsoft Windows XP Inside Out</I>. One of the most carefully researched books on Windows XP to date, this large volume has all the information and procedures most everyday users of the operating system will want. With its nicely formatted how-to instructions, detailed documentation of command-line commands, intelligent explanatory text, and broad scope, this book makes a great reference for a family or business that uses Windows XP extensively. Even the illustrations are more helpful than usual, largely because the publisher has gone to the trouble of annotating many of them with pointers and labels.<p>  Bott and Siechert deal with the most controversial features of Windows XP, notably product activation, in a straightforward way. They simply explain what activation is for, tell how to go about it, and move on. If you're a power user interested in getting around activation and performing other unsanctioned hacks, look for your information in online newsletters. This book plays by Microsoft's rules, and that's fine. It's obvious that the authors have had access to Windows XP for some time, and spent a lot of time exploring its new features. Count on this book to explain the complete set of Windows XP's features--even the exciting networking stuff--in terms you can easily follow. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Microsoft Windows XP (Professional and Home editions) for home and office users who want to install, use, and run applications. Emphasis is on basic set-up and configuration, hardware installation and modification, file management, multimedia, and networking.

review: <I>Cisco IOS Access Lists</I> takes a methodical approach to access lists and their capabilities, and is ideal for administrators of Cisco equipment who have configured access lists before but feel as if they're not taking full advantage of their capabilities (which, author Jeff Sedayao proves, extend well beyond security). Much of what Sedayao has written is of a "policy engineering" nature, is not strictly focused on Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and has relevance to administrators of all sorts of access control equipment. There's emphasis on traffic minimization as well as security, as a section on using access lists to keep routing updates off stub networks exemplifies.<p>  Like many books in the blue system-administration series, this one includes a lot of explanations of what each capability is for, and how each fits with other parts of the system. A lot of times, these sections include conceptual diagrams that show routes of communication and the desired access policies. Then come excerpts from real access lists (Sedayao focuses on IOS 10 and later) and, often, commentary on what the interesting lines of the lists are doing. It's a great way to teach people who have the ability and desire to experiment. Engineers, after all, typically like to learn by doing. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The capabilities and limitations of access lists under the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) and other similar routing and access-control environments. Access policies (with emphasis on packet filtering), routing policies (via route filtering and route maps), and the details of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) pertaining to access lists are all covered.

review: A Portable Document Format (PDF) expert debunks the myths that PDF files must be used with Adobe Acrobat Reader and that they cannot be hacked, i.e., changed in a positive sense, to deliver Web content. Steward offers many hacks for creating and modifying PDFs, e.g., self-publishing and even programming. While he is an environment agnostic who promotes free software, some tips are specific to Acrobat 5 or 6 and to a specific operating system. A Web site is available for downloading code used in the book.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionPDF--to most of the world it stands for that rather tiresome format used for documents downloaded from the web.  Slow to load and slower to print, hopelessly unsearchable, and all but impossible to cut and paste from, the Portable Document Format doesn't inspire much affection in the average user. But PDF done right is another story.  Those who know the ins and outs of this format know that it can be much more than electronic paper.  Flexible, compact, interactive, and even searchable, PDF is the ideal way to present content across multiple platforms.   PDF Hacks unveils the true promise of Portable Document Format, going way beyond the usual PDF as paged output mechanism. PDF expert Sid Steward draws from his years of analyzing, extending, authoring, and embellishing PDF documents to present 100 clever hacks--tools, tips, quick-and-dirty or not-so-obvious solutions to common problems.   PDF Hacks will show you how to create PDF documents that are far more powerful than simple representations of paper pages. The hacks in the book cover the full range of PDF functionality, from the simple to the more complex, including generating, manipulating, annotating, and consuming PDF information.  You'll learn how to manage content in PDF, navigate it, and reuse it as necessary. Far more than another guide to Adobe Acrobat, the book covers a variety of readily available tools for generating, deploying, and editing PDF.    The little-known tips and tricks in this book are ideal for anyone who works with PDF on a regular basis, including web developers, pre-press users, forms creators, and those who generate PDF for distribution. Whether you want to fine-tune and debug your existing PDF documents or explore the full potential the format offers, PDF Hacks will turn you into a PDF power user.

review: Written by an anonymous hacker, <I>Maximum Security</I> details hundreds of ways in which invaders may be able to penetrate your system and the steps that you can take to stop them. Before he was arrested, the author used his considerable talents to crack ATMs. Drawing on his vast experience, the author takes you on a journey of the tools that crackers have at their disposal, the ways in which they exploit holes in popular operating systems, and what protective measures are available for each.<p> At nearly 900 pages, this volume is not only an excellent reference source, but also a testimony to the sheer volume of techniques available to those who wish to illicitly gain access to systems. If you're a system administrator, this book will, quite simply, scare you silly--and it should. It will also help you take preventative steps that will ultimately allow you a well-deserved peace of mind. An included CD-ROM contains a selection of security utilities, such as SAFEsuite, a demo of PORTUS Secure Firewall, and the famous SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks), which are all discussed within the book.

review: This text introduces business and home users to the Red Hat and Fedora distributions of the high-performance GNU/Linux computer operating system. The focus is on the needs of the new Linux user and on desktop applications. Step-by-step instructions are provided for all stages of installation and configuration. New to the fourth edition are installation instructions and package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora; information on the GRUB bootloader; and a guide to the CUPS printer system. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included on two discs.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe GNU/Linux&reg;  success story is well known. Firmly established as a high-performance operating system, its worldwide installations are increasing at phenomenal rates. Much of this success has been on the server side, but more and more PC users are turning to Linux on the desktop, as well.  For those grounded in Microsoft Windows&reg; or Apple Macintosh&reg; graphical interfaces, the first look at a powerful Unix-style operating system can be daunting. This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the popular Red Hat&reg; distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and what you need to know to get over the humps.  Linux is known as a secure environment and a good platform to run a web server. These topics are among the many covered in this book. But did you know you can also burn CDs, sync a PalmPilot&#153;, and edit slideshow presentations with powerful tools on Linux? Those topics are covered here, too.  Red Hat currently provides two distributions, both documented in this book. The first is their commercial, subscription-based product, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also available through retail channels as Red Hat Professional Workstation. The second is the freely distributed Fedora distribution. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included in this book on two disks.  New in this edition are installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system.  Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora tells you how to:Prepare your system for installing LinuxInstall and configure Linux and the two popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE.Run the most popular productivity tools on Linux: mailers, web browsers, OpenOffice, and Evolution.Obtain and set up software through the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)Set up a Linux system for networking, either on your local area network (LAN), or via a dialup connection to the Internet.Use the system-administration tools included with Red Hat, GNOME, and KDE, including such valuable utilities as Samba file-sharing and the Apache web server.Understand and write shell scripts so you can peek under  the hood and extend the power of Linux.

review: Third Generation Wireless Systems, Volume 1: Post-Shannon Signal Architectures offers you an in-depth understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying today's most advanced wireless architectures, with a special emphasis on physical layer techniques and philosophies used in constructing interference-resistant wireless signals. You find in-depth coverage of a wide range of critical topics, including signal hardening, signal shaping techniques, signal expansion techniques, and active receiver concepts and techniques.  <P>A common theoretical framework is developed around the idea of a post-Shannon approach to designing communications systems. In many ways, modern wireless technology is pushing beyond the conventional limits of Claude Shannon's celebrated "communications theory." Topics like multipath fading and other channel phenomena are viewed in a new light - no longer as simply unavoidable sources of degradation, but as potential resources for additional information and signal robustness.  <P>This is the first in a series of leading-edge volumes on next-generation wireless systems and technologies authored by George M. Calhoun.

review: The title of David N. Blank-Edelman's new book, <I>Perl for System  Administration</I>, is strangely redundant and thankfully misleading. The soul  and source of Perl's core competence is Unix system administration, and another  O'Reilly tome on Perl tricks for managing backups would not have been welcome.  But the subtitle <I>Managing Multiplatform Environments with Perl</I>  communicates the essential task: how to administer heterogeneous Unix, Windows  NT/2000, and Mac OS systems from the same Perl-based conceptual platform.<p>  Blank-Edelman introduces this diversity of notation to motivate a far-reaching  discussion of system internals, and shows how Perl is a natural choice for  cross-platform administration. The Unix and Windows "slash" path separators--"/"  and "\", respectively--are like crossed swords, where the Mac OS uses the less- generally-known colon (":"). In lesser hands, this treatment still would have  been about LAN backups, but Blank-Edelman's familiarity with network imperatives  drives the synthesis.<p>  As the topics move beyond file systems, user accounts, and process control, the  tripartite division in the discussion breaks down. Treatments of TCP/IP and  e-mail feature discussions of NIS, WINS, DNS, and nslookup. The chapters on  directory services and SQL database management--while apparently digressive--are  inserted tactically to enable elegant approaches to the more mundane  administrative tasks of sending and receiving e-mail and managing log files to  maximize their utility. Blank-Edelman's keen pragmatism shines in the chapter on  security in which noticing intrusion earlier instead of later draws on many of  the skills that are developed throughout the book. Notably, each chapter ends  with a recapitulation of Perl modules that were referenced in the preceding  text.<p>  The eclectic tutorial appendices--an old revision-control system (RCS), the  extensible markup language (XML), the database language (SQL), and two  undermotivated and esoteric protocols (LDAP and SNMP)--are so brief as to  function more as a Perl-free zone for shop talk than as valuable pr&eacute;cis  for their respective subjects.<p>  Delightfully, this is one of Perl's and O'Reilly's best-written books.  Blank-Edelman's wit buoys the argument without descending into the  all-too-common parlance of sappy testimonials, hollow confessions, or the  burdensome ornamentation of inside jokes and puns. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: Even long-time Mac afficianados will benefit from this guide to Apple's latest release of its revolutionary operating system and its 150 added features. Following an introduction to the most basic skills (such as how to click the mouse), the author covers desktop elements, file organization, accounts and file sharing, Panther's built-in programs such as iDVD and iPhoto, basic troubleshooting, using email and the Internet, exploring Panther's Unix innards from the command line, and new features such as the Sidebar which makes using the finder much easier. He also shares tips such as how to make Safari emulate Internet Explorer and how graphic designers can gray desktop elements that might throw off their color judgement. Mac OS 9 and Windows expatriates will appreciate the where'd it go? dictionaries in Appendices C and D.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionApple says that Mac OS X 10.3 introduces 150 new features--but that's not really true.  In fact, Panther includes many more than that.  It's faster, more polished, and much more efficient.  But it still comes without a manual.With 300,000 copies in print, the first two versions of this book became industry bestsellers.  Now David Pogue brings his humor and expertise to this completely rewritten, greatly expanded edition.  It covers:Getting started.  The early chapters demystify the Dock, windows, and the unfamiliar Mac OS X folder structure--an ideal introduction.New technologies.  Mac OS X 10.3 brings breakthroughs in window management (Expose, the Sidebar); security (File Vault, Secure Empty Trash); and productivity (faxing, Fast User Switching).Bonus software.  Panther comes with over 50 free programs--and this book gives you expertise in all of them.  This beefed-up edition includes all-new mini-manuals on iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, iChat AV, and Safari.Basics of Unix. You can completely ignore Panther's Unix core.  But if the command line intrigues you, this book offers a gentle introduction.Finding familiar features.  Two Where'd It Go? Dictionaries make it easy for Mac OS 9 and Windows refugees to look up a traditional feature--and find out where it went in Mac OS X 10.3.As always, Mac OS X: The Missing Manual offers warm, witty writing, and bursts with the shortcuts, surprises, and design touches that make the Mac the most passionately championed computer in the world.

review: Virtual Classroom covers basic program features and techniques  step by step, with helpful notes and shortcuts. Per the series,  it also includes video lessons on a CD-ROM that show and expand  on the techniques in the text. Adobe's official effort,  Classroom in a Book starts with a quick tour of common functions  and moves on to more detailed lessons on specific topics and  techniques, such as creating web graphics and working with  layers. The review questions and suggestions for further  practice ending each chapter, as well as the CD's lesson art  files, are useful self-study aids. QuickStart jumps right into  the Illustrator interface, though it does so a bit messily at  first. Other chapters, however, provide helpful illustrations  and screen shots. This is better reference than self-study  material readers can easily look up how to accomplish common  tasks. Special Edition is more appropriate for intermediate to  advanced users, spending extra time covering version 10's new  features and advanced topics like dynamic data-driven graphics.  Troubleshooting sections at the end of each chapter answer  common questions. All of these titles are appropriate purchases  for public libraries. Institutions owning version 9 guides  should upgrade for coverage of 10's new features.

review: <I>Graphics & Web Page Design</I> is a four-color book about creating both Web graphics and Web pages. The chapters on Web graphics are particularly useful because they offer concrete advice on how to design text, buttons, icons, inline images, transparent GIF images, animations, and more. But unlike other books, <I>Graphics & Web Page Design</I> shows you how to create graphics in the context of a well-designed Web page. After all, many people who are creating Web graphics are also creating Web pages. For example, the writers explain how to plan your site's design and navigation. They discuss image maps and frames in the same chapter, so you can get a good idea of different ways to organize your site. And although you learn how to create backgrounds and textures, you are warned that indiscrete use of these elements can ruin the look and readability of your Web page.<p> The authors, by the way, don't try to teach you HTML. They discuss a variety of tools, but most of the graphics techniques are done in Adobe Photoshop. There's also a brief discussion of Web file formats and general information on raster- and vector-based tools such as CorelDRAW and Fractal Painter. A CD includes Web page and image-map editors, conversion utilities, and much more.

review: Richard Munden demonstrates how to create and use simulation models for verifying ASIC and FPGA designs and board-level designs that use off-the-shelf digital components. Based on the VHDL/VITAL standard, these models include timing constraints and propagation delays that are required for accurate verification of todays digital designs. <br><br>ASIC and FPGA Verification: A Guide to Component Modeling expertly illustrates how ASICs and FPGAs can be verified in the larger context of a board or a system. It is a valuable resource for any designer who simulates multi-chip digital designs.<br><br>*Provides numerous models and a clearly defined methodology for performing board-level simulation.<br>*Covers the details of modeling for verification of both logic and timing.  <br>*First book to collect and teach techniques for using VHDL to model "off-the-shelf" or "IP" digital components for use in FPGA and board-level design verification., Digital electronic designs continue to evolve toward more complex, higher pincount components operating at higher clock frequencies. This makes debugging board designs in a lab considerably more difficult. At the same time, the interfaces to standard components on the board are often not verified until a prototype is built. While engineers agree that fixing problems at that stage in the design process is too expensive, they have not performed up-front board-level simulation because they lack models and a methodology for doing so. This book specifically addresses both these issues. Rick Munden details the creation and use of models designed to verify ASIC and FPGA designs as well as board-level designs that use off-the-shelf digital components. The models are based on the VHDL/VITAL standard. He introduces board-level verification and presents a simple VHDL/VITAL model, describes the essential standards and resources, and demonstrates basic applications.

review: The authors, members of the core development team for Perl 6, describe the newest developments in the design philosophy, basic syntax, and subroutines of the project--in particular those relating to Parrot, the language-dependent virtual machine that can be used to interpret other dynamic languages such as Python, Tel, Ruby and Java. They include descriptions of the newest upgrades to Apocalypse 12 (objects) as well as Apocalypse 5 (regular expressions) and Apocalypse 6 (subroutines). They also include resources programmers and developers can use to contribute to the project.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionDistilling many years of Perl experience--including an insiders look at Perl development  (the authors are members of the Perl 6 core development team)--Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials, 2nd Edition is an unparalleled preview of major changes in the widely-anticipated Perl 6. This sneak peek of what's coming in Perl includes succinct but thorough coverage of groundbreaking new developments in Parrot--the language-independent interpreter engine that will execute code written in the new Perl 6 language. Designed to be language independent, Parrot can be used to interpret other dynamic languages such as Python, Tcl, Ruby, and even Java.  Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials also uncovers the most revolutionary change in the language itself--Apocalypse 12 on objects.  The Apocalypse design documents (in the sense of revealing, not end-of-the-world) explain significant changes in new Perl 6 features, numbered according to the chapters in O'Reilly's landmark  Camel book , Programming Perl.   Apocalypse 12 is the result of cutting-edge research in object-oriented languages and is guaranteed to grab the attention of any serious Perl programmer. Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials also includes expanded coverage of Apocalypse 5 (regular expressions) and Apocalypse 6 (subroutines).  Perl 6 and Parrot Essentials is the only book available to chart the course of the long but fruitful voyage of Perl 6. It reveals all the ingenious developments that will make Perl 6 more powerful and easier to use.   Perl gurus and programmers alike will rely on this slim but essential book for both a clear view of the Perl horizon and to ensure they hit the ground running once this important new version of Perl is released.

review: As the title implies, <I>Web Programming with Java</I> aims to teach you applet programming  for the World Wide Web rather than how to create stand-alone Java applications. It assumes that you have  some programming skills, although experience using object-oriented design is not required. The book  begins by covering Java language basics and introducing the Java class libraries. The second section moves  on to the Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT), graphics, exception handling, and other core concepts. Once  you're armed with these tools, the authors take you through the creation of an order entry system applet,  starting with a bare-bones program and progressively adding functionality. The final part of the book deals  with more advanced Java techniques such as network programming, utility classes, and multithreading.  Additional chapters touch on security issues, advanced graphics, database applications, and game applets.  The CD-ROM includes the JavaSoft Java Developer's Kit (JDK) v. 1.0.2 for Solaris, Windows 95/NT, and  Macintosh. A Web site supporting the book is also available. If you're interested in mastering the life cycle  of an applet, from conception to loading it onto a Web page, <I>Web Programming with Java</I> is a good  pick.

review: PHP is an open-source Web scripting language that's gaining steam in the  development community, especially in the Apache Web server realm. With a syntax  that draws heavily on C, PHP appeals to advanced programmers who are moving to  the Web from traditional software development.<p>  <I>Web Application Development with PHP 4.0</I> isn't your run-of-the-mill  language tutorial. Authors Ratschiller and Gerken purposely designed its content  to appeal to coders who already are proficient in PHP, but in need of advanced  programming techniques and high-level application-development skills. Assuming a  strong programming foundation, this book can be considered a next-level PHP  tutorial.<p>  Drawing on their own experience of what's really important in PHP development,  the authors dive into topics such as linked lists and associative arrays. They  also weave together topics like security and database access with such  software-development issues as three-tier architecture, versioning, and program  requirements. This balance makes for a nice fit for developers who have mastered  the basics, but are looking to hone their skills to move to the next level.<p>  The book also goes into how to extend PHP by modifying its Zend language engine  via the C source code. A companion CD includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache, as well  as a number of utilities and the source code from the book. If already you're  deep into PHP and want to graduate to guru status, this book's for you.  <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Development planning, coding conventions, advanced PHP  syntax, associative arrays, polymorphism and self-modifying code, application  design, HTTP and sessions, PHP normal form, database access with PHP, PHP, and  XML, and extending PHP Zend engine.

review: This terrific reference book condenses the material of at least five huge volumes on Web site construction into a single small one. It doesn't teach how to develop and maintain a Web site, but it puts all the commands, syntax information, and related knowledge where you can find them quickly. Sections cover HTML, CGI, HTTI, JavaScript, and server configurations. Each section begins with a brief overview of the topic then follows with a series of well-organized lists, charts, and other reminders to help you rapidly find a little-used command or forgotten bit of information.

review: If you are a Python programmer who wants to incorporate  XML into your skill set, this is the book for you.  Python has attracted a wide variety of developers, who  use it either as glue to connect critical programming  tasks together, or as a complete cross-platform application  development language. Yet, because it is object-oriented and  has powerful text manipulation abilities, Python is an ideal  language for manipulating XML.    <i>Python & XML</i> gives you a solid foundation for using  these two languages together. Loaded with practical examples,  this new volume highlights common application tasks, so that  you can learn by doing. The book starts with the basics then  quickly progresses to complex topics, like transforming XML  with XSLT, querying XML with XPath, and working with XML  dialects and validation. It also explores the more advanced  issues: using Python with SOAP and distributed web services,  and using Python to create scalable streams between distributed  applications (like databases and web servers).     The book provides effective practical applications, while  referencing many of the tools involved in XML processing and  Python, and highlights cross-platform issues along with tasks  relevant to enterprise computing. You will find ample coverage  of XML flow analysis and details on ways in which you can  transport XML through your network.     Whether you are using Python as an application language, or  as an administrative or middleware scripting language,  you are sure to benefit from this book. If you want to use  Python to manipulate XML, this is your guide.

review: Suitable for Visual Basic programmers of all levels, <I>Programming Visual Basic .NET</I> is a solid, one-volume tutorial of basic and advanced features, with good coverage of new support for Web development. Whether you have been working with VB for years or are coming to VB .NET from another language, this book's no-nonsense tour will get you working with VB .NET with a minimum of hassle.<p>  This title's compact format has to be one of its most appealing features. After covering the basics of what's new in VB .NET, the author digs in with a fast-moving, authoritative tour of all essential language features in the new version. This language tutorial really shines as it covers topics such as basic language statements, data types, and variables and defining classes using properties, methods, and inheritance (and more advanced bells and whistles). Short code excerpts illustrate just how to program quickly, and many readers will find this material useful as a reference for day-to-day questions about specific language features as they come up in real projects.<p>  Of course, .NET has a brand-new set of APIs too. The author concentrates on basic Windows Forms and Web forms programming. The section on basic database ADO.NET (including bound controls) is a standout and will get you started with these essential programming APIs. Coverage of Web services will put using this new approach to building distributed systems within reach of many readers. (Here, the author provides some advice for creating effective distributed Web services.)<p>  By focusing first on the language itself, this book will help virtually anyone get started with the latest version of Microsoft's most popular programming language without getting bogged down in the many details of the .NET platform. With plenty of detail for the expert, yet entirely approachable for the beginner, this title will serve both as a reference and a tutorial for getting onboard with this new version. It provides a valuable and timely resource for the aspiring VB .NET developer. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to the .NET framework and Visual Basic; in-depth tutorial to VB .NET (including keywords, data types, operators, and expressions, classes, interfaces, exception handling, delegates and events); the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), the Common Type System (CTS), garbage collection, overview of built-in .NET namespaces; Windows Forms, building MDI applications, basic graphics programming with GDI+, using common controls, menus, event handling, basic Web development with VB .NET (server controls, validation, maintaining state and application-level settings); creating custom controls, Web services (including WSDL and discovery), ADO.NET database programming (SQL Server and OLE DB APIs compared, the DataSet and DataReader classes, grid controls); references to .NET attributes, exceptions, and math functions.

review: Aimed at the more experienced developer or Windows administrator responsible for deployment, <I>COM and .NET Component Services</I> provides an expert guide to getting the most out of COM+ services on the Windows 2000/XP platform, including material on the new .NET platform. This guide will help you create state-of-the-art, scalable Windows components that take full advantage of transactions, object pooling, and powerful administrative features available in COM+.<p>  While Microsoft is about to replace COM components with the new .NET standard, COM+ is still a viable technology and will be fully supported (and even enhanced) in the new .NET Framework. Much of <I>COM and .NET Component Services</I> concentrates on C++ and Visual Basic examples that explore areas of functionality, plus practical tips for configuring and administering components with such tools as the COM+ Services Explorer.<p>  The expert perspective here will help you design components that work with COM+ effectively. There is plenty of background material on COM+ topics like marshaling and interception, which allow objects to be pooled behind the scenes on the Windows platform. But the focus is on the real APIs and programming techniques developers need to work with COM+. This practical focus extends to specific suggestions and pitfalls to avoid for each area of COM+ development. There is good material on COM+ transactions here, along with some excellent material on asynchronous components that tap COM+ queuing capabilities.<p>  The book concludes with a long chapter on .NET, which brings this title current with Microsoft's new programming platform. The author recaps the APIs covered earlier in the book using .NET and C#. (COM+ is still a part of .NET, but you'll use a different set of APIs and programming language to work with it.) The book concludes with a glance at new COM+ 1.5 features, plus a quick introduction to .NET. <p>  In all, this title strikes a good balance between the old and the new. After reading this smart and fast-moving text, developers will be able to immediately learn COM+ skills that will have practical benefit for both current and future Windows software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview on COM+ Components (features and basic deployment), COM+ contexts (marshaling and interception), COM+ instance management, object pooling, just-in-time activation (JITA), COM+ transactions, transaction basics, compensating transactions, two-phase commits and voting, apartments and concurrency, activities, the neutral threading apartment, APIs for manipulating the COM+ catalog, security (roles, programmatic security and pitfalls), queued components (synchronous and asynchronous components), COM+ events and the Event Service (filtering, distributed and asynchronous events), sample code in C++ (and Visual Basic 6), .NET serviced components, .NET packages and APIs for COM+ development, introduction to COM+ 1.5 and the .NET Framework, and administration and programming hints for COM+.

review: Support for regular expressions in SQL and PL/SQL is one of the most exciting features of Oracle Database 10G.  Oracle has long supported the ANSI-standard LIKE predicate for rudimentary pattern matching, but regular expressions take pattern matching to a new level. They provide a powerful way to select data that matches a pattern, as well as to manipulate, rearrange, and change that data.  This concise pocket guide is part tutorial and part quick-reference. It's suitable for those who have never used regular expressions before, as well as those who have experience with Perl and other languages supporting regular expressions. The book describes Oracle Database 10G's support for regular expressions, including globalization support and differences between Perl's syntax and the POSIX syntax supported by Oracle 10G. It also provides a comprehensive reference, including examples, to all supported regular expression operators, functions, and error messages.  O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers and database administrators everywhere.  By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. Whether you're using regular expressions for the first time or applying your skills from other languages to the latest version of Oracle, the Oracle Regular Expressions Pocket Reference is the book to have close by.

review: Introduces the major components and standard libraries of the Python programming language.  The guide walks through string and regular expression handling, how to access files and directories, XML processing, CGI scripting, Tkinter, and wxPython.  The more advanced chapters describe sound and image processing, multithreading, writing extension modules, embedding the Python interpreter, and arrays. The book shows Hungry Minds as the publisher, but that company is now part of Wiley.Book News, Inc.&#174, Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe Python 2.1 Bible provides the only complete Python language reference on the market and includes all the information and software that developers need to use Python as a rapid application development tool.        The Python 2.1 Bible fills a critical void in the Python reference market. Although it includes a complete Python language reference section, it is still geared towards those of you who already have some programming experience. This book explains each piece of technology in depth and shows through clear examples why each feature is useful. This is the manual you've been waiting for -- the one that covers all major Python components without glossing over how the various pieces fit together.

review: The definitive, Jolt-award winning guide to learning and using Rails is now in its Second Edition. Rails is a new approach to web-based application development that enables developers to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications using less code and less effort. Now programmers can get the job done right and still leave work on time. <p> NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION: The book has been updated to take advantage of all the new Rails 1.2 features. The sample application uses migrations, Ajax, features a REST interface, and illustrates new Rails features. There are new chapters on migrations, active support, active record, and action controller (including the new resources-based routing). The Web 2.0 and Deployment chapters have been completely rewritten to reflect the latest thinking. Now you can learn which environments are best for your style application, and see how Capistrano makes managing your site simple. All the remaining chapters have been extensively updated. Finally, hundreds of comments from readers of the first edition have been incorporated, making this book simply the best available. <p> Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications with a twist...you can create a full Rails application using less code than the setup XML you'd need just to configure some other frameworks. <p> With this book, you'll learn how to use Rails Active Record to connect business objects and database tables.  No more painful object-relational mapping.  Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest.  You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, talk to web services, and interact dynamically with JavaScript applications running in the browser (the "Ajax" architecture).   <p> You'll see how easy it is to deploy Rails.  You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.

review: Windows XP is the latest, most reliable, and best-looking version of the Windows operating system to emerge yet.  As the result of the unification of Microsoft's corporate series (Windows NT and 200) with the home series (Windows 95, 98, and Me), Windows XP offers much that is pleasing to its users: rock-solid stability and a fresh new look.  But power users who want to take command of their operating systems will find the same old frustrations: it's never been easy to get under the hood of a Windows system and Windows XP is no exception.  Now power users can rejoice! Windows XP Hacks offers tips, tools, and know-how to bend Windows XP to your will.  The book delves into XP topics such as controlling the control panel, changing unchangeable icons, removing uninstallable XP components, stopping pop-up ads, taking a bite out of cookies, speeding up file downloads, protecting yourself with firewalls and proxy servers, and more. Users of both Windows XP Home Edition and Windows XP Pro Edition will find smart, timesaving, fun, and useful hacks for virtually every feature in their operating system. Even if you're not a power user yet, this book will have you well on your way.   Each Hack in the book can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer. Windows XP Hacks provides direct, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing both those meeting Windows XP for the first time as well as long-time users who know what they want from their operating system and just wants tips on how to get it.  Windows XP Hacks is the latest in O'Reilly's new Hacks Series which aims to begin reclaiming the term hacking for the good guys. In recent years, the term has come to be associated with those nefarious black hats who break into computers to snoop, steal information or disrupt Internet traffic. But the term originally had a more benign meaning, and you'll still hear it used this way whenever developers get together. Our new Hacks books are written in the spirit of the true hackers -- the people who drive innovation.

review: Paperback edition.Java Peformance Tuning, 2nd edition provides a comprehensive and indispensable guide to eliminating all types of performance problems. Using many real-life examples to work through the tuning process in detail, JPT shows how tricks such as minimizing object creation and replacing strings with arrays can really pay off in improving your code's performance.  Tuning J2EE applications bears many similarities to tuning J2SE apps, but important and specific considerations apply. For this reason, Java Performance Tuning, Second Edition includes four new chapters: a new chapter on J2EE application tuning in general followed by chapters on tuning JDBC, servlets and JSPs, and EJBs.   Java Performance Tuning offers common-sense advice about what to tune and what to leave alone, emphasizing techniques that provide big performance gains with minimal code restructuring. It gives you crucial guidance that helps you tune without destroying your program's architecture. Blindly changing things in an effort to make a program run faster is a great way to create buggy, unmaintainable code. Java Performance Tuning teaches you to work efficiently and effectively, resulting in code that is robust, maintainable, and fast.

review: In 1998, Jennifer Niederst wrote the first edition of this very successful book after she found herself spending way too much time chasing down the solutions to HTML problems. From hexadecimal color specs to mouseover scripts, the answers are all out there, but finding the exact one you need can soak up a whole day. "I wrote <I>Web Design in a Nutshell</I> because it was the book I needed--one place to find quick answers to my questions."<p>  With all that's changed in the meantime, an overhaul is welcome. This is the rare book for designers that is almost completely nonvisual. It doesn't show what's hip in navigational bars or what the coolest colors are. Rather, it gives readers the kind of know-how that can make a difference between someone who just whips up pretty pages with WYSIWYG applications like Dreamweaver and someone who can make those pages cross-platform, cross-browser, fast loading, and accessible to all.<p>  The clear organization makes it easy to locate any specific topic. There are six sections. "The Web Environment" discusses the realities of browser compatibility, display-resolution problems, a useful bit of Unix, and tips for print designers looking to move into Web design. "Authoring" shows how to write accurate and up-to-date HTML, cascading style sheets, and Server Side Includes (like putting the current date and time on your homepage).<p>  "Graphics" brings together all you need to know to make effective use of images (GIFs, JPEGS, PNGs, and animated GIFs). "Multimedia and Interactivity" helps with adding audio, video, or Flash to your site (including some succinct tips on optimization and publish settings). And "Advanced Technologies" covers JavaScript, DHTML, XML, XHTML, and WAP and WML. And there are six useful look-up tables in the appendix, which include HTML 4.0 tags, deprecated tags, attributes, and CSS support across browsers. <I>Web Design in a Nutshell</I> could easily have been titled <I>The Web Designer's Companion</I>--it's mighty handy to have around. <I>--Angelynn Grant</I>

review: The spreadsheet is the software tool that turns everyone into a hacker by making it possible to play with numbers easily. <I>Excel Hacks</I>, therefore, makes a lot of sense. This small, fact-dense book explains how to get maximum utility from Microsoft's popular calculation application. It shows how to use all the stuff you know is in there but have never bothered to figure out (dynamic cell ranges, PivotTables, macros), and how to carry out particularly hasslesome calculations (notably those involving dates). The coverage is all the more succinct because the authors didn't feel obligated (thankfully) to include the ponderous basics of Excel--the details of formatting and simple calculation that fill up pages and pages of more typical Excel guides.<p>  The Hawleys' treatment of PivotTables is typical of their approach to Excel. The authors explain this powerful statistical analysis feature with a series of four recipes (called "hacks") that go from straight documentation of the feature (how to create an unadorned PivotTable) to more complicated tricks involving Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as it applies to PivotTables. They provide some background information along the way, but the main focus of the hacks is procedural: Follow along with the text and you'll see your spreadsheets do new tricks. You'll also understand what's going on, so you'll be better able to modify the procedures to suit your own requirements. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use the most powerful and least-understood features of Microsoft Excel (versions 2000 and later) for Windows and Mac OS. Sections address data lookups, statistical calculations, charting, macros, and general tricks for enhanced efficiency.

review: Setting up and maintaining a Linux server requires understanding not only the hardware, but the ins and outs of the Linux operating system along with its supporting cast of utilities as well as layers of applications software.  There's basic documentation online but there's a lot beyond the basics you have to know, and this only comes from people with hands-on, real-world experience.  This kind of  know how is what we sought to capture in Linux Server Hacks.  Linux Server Hacks is a collection of 100 industrial-strength hacks, providing tips and tools that solve practical problems for Linux system administrators.  Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer. Some of the hacks are subtle, many of them are non-obvious, and all of them demonstrate the power and flexibility of a Linux system.   You'll find hacks devoted to tuning the Linux kernel to make your system run more efficiently, as well as using CVS or RCS to track the revision to system files.  You'll learn alternative ways to do backups, how to use system monitoring tools to track system performance and a variety of secure networking solutions. Linux Server Hacks also helps you manage large-scale Web installations running Apache, MySQL, and other open source tools that are typically part of a Linux system.     O'Reilly's new Hacks Series proudly reclaims the term hacking for the good guys. Hackers use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems.

review: Intended for C/C++ programmers new to artificial intelligence, this book shows how to give game characters believable intelligence by employing a mix of deterministic and newer AI techniques. Bourg (New Orleans School of Marine Engineering) and Seemann (Crescent Vision Interactive) explain the principles behind pattern movement, flocking, pathfinding, finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and genetic algorithms.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionAdvances in 3D visualization and physics-based simulation technology make it possible for game developers to create compelling, visually immersive gaming environments that were only dreamed of years ago. But today's game players have grown in sophistication along with the games they play. It's no longer enough to wow your players with dazzling graphics; the next step in creating even more immersive games is improved artificial intelligence, or AI.    Fortunately, advanced AI game techniques are within the grasp of every game developer--not just those who dedicate their careers to AI. If you're new to game programming or if you're an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to speed quickly on AI techniques, you'll find AI for Game Developers to be the perfect starting point for understanding and applying AI techniques to your games.    Written for the novice AI programmer, AI for Game Developers introduces you to techniques such as finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and many others, in straightforward, easy-to-understand language, supported with code samples throughout the entire book (written in C/C++). From basic techniques such as chasing and evading, pattern movement, and flocking to genetic algorithms, the book presents a mix of deterministic (traditional) and non-deterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at beginners AI developers. Other topics covered in the book include:Potential function based movements: a technique that handles chasing, evading swarming, and collision avoidance simultaneouslyBasic pathfinding and waypoints, including an entire chapter devoted to the A* pathfinding algorithmAI scriptingRule-based AI: learn about variants other than fuzzy logic and finite state machinesBasic probabilityBayesian techniquesUnlike other books on the subject, AI for Game Developers doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of game AI, but to provide you with usable, advanced techniques you can apply to your games right now.

review: With <I>The Da Vinci Code,</I> Dan Brown masterfully concocts an intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating esoteria culled from 2,000 years of Western history. <p>  A murder in the silent after-hour halls of the Louvre museum reveals a sinister plot to uncover a secret that has been protected by a clandestine society since the days of Christ. The victim is a high-ranking agent of this ancient society who, in the moments before his death, manages to leave gruesome clues at the scene that only his granddaughter, noted cryptographer Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a famed symbologist, can untangle. The duo become both suspects and detectives searching for not only Neveu's grandfather's murderer but also the stunning secret of the ages he was charged to protect. Mere steps ahead of the authorities and the deadly competition, the mystery leads Neveu and Langdon on a breathless flight through France, England, and history itself.   Brown (<I>Angels and Demons</I>) has created a page-turning thriller that also provides an amazing interpretation of Western history. Brown's hero and heroine embark on a lofty and intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail. Though some will quibble with the veracity of Brown's conjectures, therein lies the fun. <I>The Da Vinci Code</I> is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought. <I>--Jeremy Pugh</I>

review: Managed DirectX was released with the latest version of the core DirectX libraries in DirectX9. It enables developers using the new .NET languages (i.e. C#, VB.NET, etc.) to develop rich multimedia applications with DirectX. Unfortunately the Managed DirectX runtime was released without adequate documentation, and developers are having a hard time figuring out the best way to write managed applications. This book covers how to use the Managed DirectX objects, how they differ from the core DirectX libraries, and how to create these rich multimedia applications in C#. It also covers in depth graphics techniques and the new high-level shader language shipping with DirectX9.About the AuthorTom Miller is the development lead for Managed DirectX, as well as the designer of the API. He has worked on the DirectX team for the last four years, including the SDK team writing samples, as well as the DirectX for Visual Basic team. Previously at Microsoft, he worked on the Visual Basic and Office teams.

review: Ideal for Mac geeks who like to play under the hood and Unix veterans switching to Mac, the 100 tips in this collection show how to modify the GUI, write AppleScipts, optimize internet surfing, get creative with iLife, share files with other Macs, and protect data stored on the computer. A thermometer rates the difficulty of each hack. Some of the hacks are updated from the previous Mac OS X edition, while others are brand new for Panther.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionLike the animal it's named for, Mac OS X Panther is beautiful, sleek, superbly efficient, dangerously alluring, and all muscle under the surface. Beneath its appealing interface, it's a hard-working machine. Those coming to Mac OS X from previous incarnations of the operating system recognize much of the friendly face of the Macintosh they're used to, but they're also plunged into a whole new world. Unix converts to Mac OS X find a familiar FreeBSD-like operating system at the core and many of the command-line applications that they're familiar with: it's like an open invitation to roll up their sleeves and hack.  Mac OS X Panther Hacks brings together the perfect combination of tips, tricks, and tools to help serious Mac users--regardless of their background--get the most from their machines.  This revised collection reflects the real-world know how of those well-steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs.  The end result is cool stuff no power user should be without.  The hacks in the book range from the quick and easy to the more complex. Each can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer. Mac OS X Panther Hacks provides direct, hands-on solutions in topics such as:User InterfaceAccessories (iPod, USB devices, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.)Wired and wireless networking (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.)Email (servers and clients)Web (servers and clients)Messaging (iChat and associated apps)Printing and Faxing (sharing printers, fax server, etc.)MultimediaIf you want more than your average Mac user--you want to explore and experiment, unearth shortcuts, create useful tools, and come up with fun things to try on your own--this book will set you on the right track.  Written for users who need to go beyond what's covered in conventional manuals--Mac OS X Panther Hacks will bring your Mac to its full potential.

review: Be more productive and make your life easier. That's what LDAP System Administration is all about.  System administrators often spend a great deal of time managing configuration information located on many different machines: usernames, passwords, printer configurations, email client configurations, and network filesystem configurations, to name a few. LDAPv3 provides tools for centralizing all of the configuration information and placing it under your control. Rather than maintaining several administrative databases (NIS, Active Directory, Samba, and NFS configuration files), you can make changes in only one place and have all your systems immediately see the updated information.  If you want to be a master of your domain, LDAP System Administration will help you get up and running quickly regardless of which LDAP version you use. After reading this book, even with no previous LDAP experience, you'll be able to integrate a directory server into essential network services such as mail, DNS, HTTP, and SMB/CIFS.

review: The Jakarta Struts Framework is a popular open source platform for building web applications from top to bottom with Java.  While this popularity has led to a wealth of online and in-print documentation, developers still find themselves faced with a number of common tasks that are not clearly and succinctly explained.  In these situations, programmers can now turn to the Jakarta Struts Cookbook an amazing collection of code solutions to common--and uncommon--problems encountered when working with the Struts Framework.  Among many other recipes, this book explains how to:display data in complex HTML tablesuse JSP, the JSTL, and JavaScript in your user interfacedefine static and dynamic action formsvalidate data and respond to errorsuse Logging, Validation, and Exception Handlingintegrate Struts with persistence frameworks like Hibernate and iBATISThis look-up reference is just what today's time-pressed developers need. With solutions to real-world problems just a few page flips away, information is instantly available. And while the book's solutions focus on getting to the point, each recipe's discussion section imparts valuable concept and insight from a Struts veteran.  The Jakarta Struts Cookbook is perfect for independent developers, large development teams, and everyone in between who wishes to use the Struts Framework to its fullest potential.  Plus, it s completely up-to-date with the latest versions of Framework, so readers can be sure the information is viable.

review: There's far more to information security than usernames and passwords; it's not just a matter of letting legitimate users "in" and keeping bad guys "out." Users who have authority to use certain parts of a system may not be authorized to see everything, and businesses, for billing purposes, often want to track how long users spend in a system. The Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) solves all of these engineering challenges, but you have to implement it correctly in order to achieve maximum benefit and keep your systems safe. <I>RADIUS</I> provides an architectural and technical guide to RADIUS implementation, enabling its readers to design RADIUS-secured systems properly and choose products wisely.<p>Jonathan Hassell's approach is to lay down a foundation of RADIUS protocol theory, then explain how to implement the protocol with a particular product (FreeRADIUS for Linux). He approaches both elements of his book with precision and detail, and provides plenty of tabular information for reference. He's also liberal with examples, which is a welcome trait if you're in a hurry to know how to format a radiusd.conf file or how to configure Cisco IOS to do RADIUS authentication. This is a comprehensive treatment of a complicated subject. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</b> How the RADIUS protocol provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA services), and how it fits with other elements of network design. The author covers the protocol in theory before digging into its implementation in FreeRADIUS for Linux and the integration of that package with several important networking products.

review: Written for programmers familiar with the C programming language, this guide uses tutorials to illustrate the most important concepts and techniques related to using the GNU/Linux system in application programs.  It provides instruction on software development, programming, reliability, and security.  The peculiarities of the GNU/Linux system are detailed, with attention to is limitations, special capabilities, and conventions.  The authors are software engineers.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionAdvanced Linux Programming is divided into two parts. The first covers generic UNIX system services, but with a particular eye towards Linux specific information. This portion of the book will be of use even to advanced programmers who have worked with other Linux systems since it will cover Linux specific details and differences. For programmers without UNIX experience, it will be even more valuable.The second section covers material that is entirely Linux specific. These are truly advanced topics, and are the techniques that the gurus use to build great applications.  While this book will focus mostly on the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by the Linux kernel and the C library, a preliminary introduction to the development tools available will allow all who purchase the book to make immediate use of Linux.

review: <I>Mac OS X: The Missing Manual</I> ranks among the best books to have at your side as you explore the latest Macintosh operating system as an everyday user who wants to get some work done, have a bit of fun, and feel part of the Mac community. David Pogue--a respected Mac authority and longtime author on the subject--is the perfect guide on such a quest, as his Mac knowledge is profound and his ability to explain facts and procedures considerable. The second edition of this popular book covers Mac OS X 10.2 and all of its many new features, including Sherlock 3, iCal, iSync, and firewalling. There's coverage of .Mac online services, as well.<p>Pogue writes really well, so his prose is a treat to read and most readers will appreciate his occasional page-long straight prose passages. More often, though, the wisdom in this book comes in the form of annotated procedures and bulleted lists, as well as notes and tips. There are also two highly handy "Where'd It Go?" glossaries: one for longtime Mac users (this one answers such questions as where the Apple Extras folder is) and one for Windows users (to explain, for example, the equivalent of Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the Mac). Unlike most books about Mac OS X, this one explores its  UNIX-like underpinnings (the Apple implementation is called Darwin) pretty thoroughly. However, based on the logic that if you wanted to use UNIX, you would, Pogue emphasizes the traditional, graphical Mac interface over the Terminal window. If you want an in-depth treatment of Darwin and know something about UNIX already, have a look at <I>Mac OS X for Unix Geeks</I>. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to use Mac OS X 10.2 and its immediate predecessors. This is a user-level book, concerned with managing files, folders, media, users, and hardware. Lots of attention goes to the operating system's special features, including the "i" series of applications and the .Mac online services.

review: Brimming with over 100 recipes for getting down to business and actually doing XP,  the Java Extreme Programming Cookbook  doesn't try to sell you on XP; it succinctly documents the most important features of popular open source tools for XP in Java-- including Ant, Junit, HttpUnit, Cactus, Tomcat, XDoclet-- and then digs right in, providing recipes for implementing the tools in real-world environments.   Each recipe offers solutions that help you put an extreme programming environment together: then provides code for automating the build process and testing. Although the time saved using any one of these solutions will more than pay for the book, Java Extreme Programming Cookbook offers more than just a collection of cut-and-paste code.  Each recipe also includes explanations of how and why the approach works, so you can adapt the techniques to similar situations.

review: The O'Reilly Cookbook series, with its to-the-point but illuminating coverage of programming subjects, meets the challenge of explaining how to write software as well as anything else on the market. When you're facing a coding problem--particularly in a language you're new to or haven't used in a while--and know there must be a proven way to solve it, the right Cookbook can often get you going in a hurry. <I>C# Cookbook</I> applies the formula to the language of Microsoft .NET, and is an addition to the line that more than a few programmers will appreciate.<p>  Don't count on this book to solve big tasks for you. "I need some C# software that integrates with Avaya telephone switches and Siemens databases...:" No. Rather, this book shows you how to do the little jobs (converting an array to a delimited string, monitoring the event log, creating a bounded hashtable, and so on) that can stand in the way of prompt completion of a project. What's more, the coverage isn't limited to code samples. Stephen Teilhet and Jay Hilyard take advantage of the Cookbook series' Problem-Solution-Discussion format to teach you a thing or two about C#. You'll refer to this book often for quick answers and explanations. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to solve small but non-trivial problems in the C# programming language. Each of 17 chapters covers a major area of C# functionality--networking, regular expressions, filesystem, security, and so on--and contains a dozen or two entries on how best to solve programming problems.

review: This lively and readable book is the perfect introduction for those venturing into embedded systems software development for the first time.  It provides in one place all the important topics necessary to orient programmers to the embedded development process.Book DescriptionEmbedded software is in almost every electronic device designed today. Yet because each embedded system is unique and highly customized to its application, it can be a difficult field to master. However, if you have some programming experience and are familiar with C or C++, you're ready to learn how to write embedded software. The hands-on, no-nonsense style of this book will help you get started by offering practical advice from someone who's been in your shoes and wants to help you learn quickly.  The techniques and code examples presented here are directly applicable to real-world embedded software projects of all sorts. Even if you've done some embedded programming before, you'll still benefit from this book. Topics include: testing memory chips,  writing and erasing Flash memory, verifying nonvolatile memory contents, interfacing to on-chip and external peripherals, device driver design and implementation, optimizing embedded software for size and speed, and making the most of C++ without a performance penalty.

review: Mac OS X Advanced Development Techniques introduces intermediate to advanced developers to a wide range of topics they will not find so extensively detailed anywhere else.The book concentrates on teaching Cocoa development first, and then takes that knowledge and teaches in-depth, advanced Mac OS X development through detailed examples.  Topics covered include: writing applications in Cocoa, supporting plug-in architectures, using shell scripts as startup items, understanding property lists, writing screen savers, implementing preference panes and storing global user preferences, custom color pickers, components, core and non-core services, foundations, frameworks, bundles, tools, applications and more.  Source code in Objective-C, Perl, Java, shell script, and other languages are included as appropriate.These solutions are necessary when developing Mac OS X software, but many times are overlooked due to their complexities and lack of documentation and examples.  The project-oriented approach of Mac OS X Advanced Development Techniques lends itself perfectly to those developers who need to learn a specific aspect of this new OS.  Stand-alone examples allow them to strike a specific topic with surgical precision.  Each chapter will be filled with snippets of deep, technical information that is difficult or impossible to find anywhere else.About the AuthorJoe Zobkiw is president of TripleSoft Inc., a software development firm located   in Raleigh, NC. He has been writing software for Macintosh, UNIX, and Windows   operating systems since 1986. Joe has written numerous technical articles on   software development-related topics throughout his career. His experience   includes writing communication, utility, and business applications for   commercial and private clients. This is his second book on advanced Macintosh   software development.

review: Is there such thing as a Western Taoist? Benjamin Hoff says there is, and this Taoist's favorite food is honey. Through brilliant and witty dialogue with the beloved Pooh-bear and his companions, the author of this smash bestseller explains with ease and aplomb that rather than being a distant and mysterious concept, Taoism is as near and practical to us as our morning breakfast bowl. Romp through the enchanting world of Winnie-the-Pooh while soaking up invaluable lessons on simplicity and natural living., One of the world's great Taoist masters isn't Chinese, or a venerable philosopher, but is in fact none other than A. A. Milne's effortlessly calm, still, reflective bear Winnie-the-Pooh. While Eeyore frets and Piglet hesitates and Rabbit calculates and Owl pontificates, Pooh just is. And that's the clue to the secret wisdom of the Taoists.

review: Written for .NET application designers and C# or Visual Basic .NET programmers, this book describes the purpose and function of the key security features offered by the .NET runtime, how they interact with each other, and their relationship to the security of the underlying operating system. It then explains the cryptography classes contained in the .NET class library, and lists all the types defined in the security-related namespaces of the .NET framework base class library.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionWith the spread of web-enabled desktop clients and web-server based applications, developers can no longer afford to treat security as an afterthought. It's one topic, in fact, that .NET forces you to address, since Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET Framework. Yet, because a developer's carelessness or lack of experience can still allow a program to be used in an unintended way, Programming .NET Security shows you how the various tools will help you write secure applications.  The book works as both a comprehensive tutorial and reference to security issues for .NET application development, and contains numerous practical examples in both the C# and VB.NET languages. With Programming .NET Security, you will learn to apply sound security principles to your application designs, and to understand the concepts of identity, authentication and authorization and how they apply to .NET security.

review: Steven Feuerstein's first book, Oracle PR/SQL Programming, has become an indispensable reference for both novice and experienced PL/SQL developers. This new book focuses on one particularly important and advanced aspect of Oracle's powerful PL/SQL language -- the built-in packages.  Built-in packages are collections of PL/SQL objects stored directly  in the Oracle database and available from such programming environments  as Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle application server (for  web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself.  Built-in packages dramatically extend the capabilities of PL/SQL. For  example, DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and  PL/SQL blocks of code; DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle  sessions; and DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large  objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs.  Oracle Built-in Packages is the first and only comprehensive reference  to the Oracle built-in packages. It supplies extensive examples on  using the built-ins effectively and covers the newest Oracle8 packages. The book comes with a diskette containing the companion guide,  an online tool developed by RevealNet, Inc., that provides point-and-click  access to more than 175 files of reusable source code and examples.Book InfoPulls together information about how to use the call interface to the built-ins, explains the implementation details, and supplies extensive examples on using the built-in packages effectively.  3 1/2 inch disk included.  Paper.

review: If you had a list of the words used to describe sendmail, they'd probably include reliable, flexible, configurable, complex, monolithic, and daunting. But you're not likely to find the word easy. Even seasoned sendmail pros are sometimes frustrated by the intricacies of sendmail's configuration files. With a little determination and the help of a good reference book, like sendmail, Third Edition, you can master this demanding program. But when there's a significant point release, like sendmail V8.13, where do you turn?  An excellent companion to our popular sendmail, Third Edition, the sendmail 8.13 Companion provides a timely way to document the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. The book highlights the important changes in the latest update to sendmail, pointing out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail. This is especially important now that spam is on the rise, and because mobile technology requires roving laptops to use encrypted connections.   Not surprisingly, many of the changes and additions to V8.13 have been driven by the ongoing fight against spam. Anyone concerned about spam--and who isn't?--will benefit greatly by upgrading to V8.13 sendmail. Among its many enhancements, V8.13 includes new routines that support the SPF sending site authentication standard (in the Milter library), simultaneous connection control, high connection rate control, and finer tuning of SASL parameters. The additions to the Milter library, alone, make upgrading worthwhile, but sendmail's connection control makes it a no-brainer. The key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion.  The book is divided into twenty-five chapters that parallel the chapters in the third edition of the sendmail book. For instance, if you're interested in Options configuration (Chapter 24 in sendmail), you'll turn to Chapter 24 in your companion volume to find out what's new in V8.13.   For a simple dot release (8.12 to 8.13), V8.13 sendmail has added more features, options, and fundamental changes than any other single dot release has included. If you need to set up or manage sendmail, you'll want this companion volume close at hand. Even if you aren't ready to upgrade to V8.13, you'll find the key to understanding them is the sendmail 8.13 Companion a useful guide to understanding and staying current with the latest changes in sendmail.

review: This quick-reference guide to the sendmail program provides a complete overview of sendmail, from command-line switches to configuration commands, from options declarations to macro definitions, and from m4 features to debugging switches -- all packed into a convenient carry-around booklet. sendmail is the program that acts like a traffic cop in routing and delivering mail on UNIX-based networks.  Although sendmail is used on almost every UNIX system, it's one of the last great uncharted territories -- and most difficult utilities to learn -- in UNIX system administration.  Designed as a companion volume to sendmail, 2nd Edition, this guide  covers the latest version (V8.8) from the University of California, Berkeley,  and has extensive cross-references to sections in the main volume.  Both books  are coauthored by Eric Allman, the creator of sendmail.

review: Keep your network safe from security disasters with a dependable recovery strategy    Companies are finally learning that a network disaster recovery plan is mandatory in these times, and they must be prepared to make difficult choices about network security.    In the information-packed pages of this book, Annlee Hines shares her unique and diverse work experience. She explains that the first thing you need, whatever your business may be, is reliable information and an idea of what you need to protect, as well as what you are protecting it from. She then dives into a discussion of how much you can expect to spend depending on what kind of security your network requires. She also delves into addressing the variables that determine why your needs will not necessarily be the needs of your closest competitor.    Most importantly, Hines writes this valuable material realizing that you already know how to do your job --it's just that you now have to reconsider just how vulnerable the information nervous system of your company really is.    From major terrorist attacks to natural disasters to hackers, Annlee Hines explores how to defend your network and reviews such topics as:    * Probes, viruses, worms, and Trojan horses    * The most common vulnerabilities networks face    * Understanding and justifying costs    * Lessons to be learned from successful defense strategies    * Preparing for the worst and the requirements of network survival    * Remedies, cyber recovery, and restorationBook InfoKeep your network safe from security disasters with a dependable recovery strategy. Author explores how to defend your network. Softcover.

review: Written for developers familiar with HTML and Java programming, this book introduces the new JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework for simplifying the development and maintenance of complex web-based user interfaces. Bergsten, who is a member of the JSF specification team, uses a sample web-based expense report system to illustrate how JSF components are created and rendered, user input is validated, events are handled, and data is displayed. The examples were tested on a Tomcat 5 server.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionJavaServer Faces, or JSF, brings a component-based model to web application development that's similar to the model that's been used in standalone GUI applications for years.  The technology builds on the experience gained from Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and numerous commercial and open source web application frameworks that simplify the development process.   In JavaServer Faces, developers learn how to use this new framework to build real-world web applications. The book contains everything you'll need: how to construct the HTML on the front end; how to create the user interface components that connect the front end to your business objects; how to write a back-end that's JSF-friendly; and how to create the deployment descriptors that tie everything together.    JavaServer Faces pays particular attention to simple tasks that are easily ignored, but crucial to any real application: working with tablular data, for example, or enabling and disabling buttons.  And this book doesn't hide from the trickier issues, like creating custom components or creating renderers for different presentation layers.  Whether you're experienced with JSF or a just starting out, you'll find everything you need to know about this technology in this book.  Topics covered include:The JSF environmentCreating and rendering componentsValidating inputHandling user-generated eventsControlling page navigationWorking with tabular dataInternationalizationIntegration between JSF and StrutsDeveloping custom renderers and custom componentsJavaServer Faces is a complete guide to the crucial new JSF technology.  If you develop web applications, JSF belongs in your toolkit, and this book belongs in your library.

review: Rather than focusing on applications, this guide to AppleScript provides a systematic treatment of the language from the bottom up. Covering AppleScript 1.9.2 and the new Script Editor, it explains how the language works and demonstrates how it can be used in a variety of contexts--in everyday scripts, process automation, in Cocoa, in CGI, and in combination with Perl and Ruby.  The book assumes no prior knowledge or previous programming experience, but nevertheless seeks to offer a complete treatment of the language's capabilities. Neuberg is a programmer and former editor of MacTech.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIf you want to know all about AppleScript--the how, where, and why of using it--dig into AppleScript: The Definitive Guide. It doesn't make the mistake that other books do: it isn't about scripting this or that particular application, and it doesn't assume that learning AppleScript is easy or obvious. Instead, the book teaches and documents the language in a clear and rigorous manner, just as you'd expect with any programming or scripting language.  AppleScript is a dynamic, object-oriented scripting system that allows Mac users--even novices who know nothing about programming--to directly control Macintosh applications, including the Mac OS itself.  You can write scripts to automate repetitive tasks, customize applications, and even control complex workflows.   AppleScript has always been useful, but with Mac OS X it's even more so. Nearly every application that comes with Mac OS X is scriptable. Even non-scriptable applications can often be driven with AppleScript, thanks to the new Accessibility API and GUI Scripting technologies. And now AppleScripters can put a true Aqua interface around their scripts! There's never been a more exciting time for AppleScript users.  AppleScript: The Definitive Guide explores and teaches the language from the ground up. If you're a beginner and want to learn how to write your first script or just understand what the excitement is all about, you'll be able to do so after reading this book.   Experienced AppleScripters will love having the most definitive, up-to-date AppleScript language reference available.  AppleScript: The Definitive Guide is the quintessential guide to this important Mac tool. Regardless of their level of experience, AppleScripters everywhere will turn to this book again and again.

review: Intended for experienced Java developers comfortable with Swing, this guide explores the technical underpinnings of the Mac OS X Java implementation, Apple's various additions to the Java platform, and the potential pitfalls of writing applications intended for multiple platforms. The second half describes client applications delivered via the web, the QuickTime API, SQL databases, and the process of creating Enterprise JavaBeans on Mac OS X.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionMac OS X for Java Geeks delivers a complete and detailed look at the Mac OS X platform, geared specifically at Java developers.  The book begins by laying out the Mac OS X tool set, from the included Java Runtime Environment to third-party tools IDEs and Jakarta Ant. You'll then be brought up to speed on the advanced, Mac-specific extensions to Java, including the spelling framework, speech framework, and integration with QuickTime. In addition to clear explanations of these extensions, you'll learn how to write code that falls back to non-Mac specific code when it runs on other platforms, keeping your application portable.  Once you have the fundamentals of the Mac OS X Java platform in hand, this book takes you beyond the basics. You'll learn how to get the Apache web server running, and supplement it with the Jakarta Tomcat JSP and servlet container. JSPs and servlets running on Mac OS X are covered, as is installation and connectivity to a database. Once you have your web applications up and running, you'll learn how to interface them with EJBs, as running the JBoss application server on Mac OS X is covered. Finally, the latest developments in web services, including XML-RPC and SOAP, are found within.

review: Citrix MetaFrame XP is a popular tool for people running "lights-off" data centers that must be administered remotely. <I>Configuring Citrix Metaframe XP for Windows</I> explains how the software works and why it remains important even with the improved Terminal Services native to Windows XP and the upcoming Microsoft .NET Server. More importantly, the authors go into great detail on how you should go about designing and setting up a system based on the latest remote session software from Citrix. This is the book you want to use as you plan your implementation on paper, and then begin to set it up on the equipment rack.<p>  More than anything else, this book is about documentation of nearly every little interface detail that appears on your screen as you set up and run MetaFrame XP. Want to know the meaning of every column header in the Licenses menu panel of the Citrix Management Console? It's in here. Similarly, you'll find a procedure for allocating licenses to specific servers, and another procedure for pooling licenses for use across a collection of servers. Conceptual information--what talks to what, when, and for what reason--gets less coverage, but there's enough of that to help you design smooth-running and reliable systems. Think of this as a best practices design guide combined with an administrator's manual. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: The features of all three versions of Citrix MetaFrame: XPs, XPa, and XPe, as well as of the NFuse utility for allowing access to applications via Web browsers, as they are implemented in the Windows version of the Citrix products. There's information on design strategies that have worked for others, as well as on installing the software, publishing applications on it, and configuring it for maximum ease-of-use and scalability. Special sections address NFuse portals, remote accessibility, and printing problems.

review: Unix ranks among the great engineering accomplishments of the last half of the twentieth century, and its heir--Linux--seems already imposing and still on its way to achieving its full potential. Eric S. Raymond argues in <I>The Art of UNIX Programming</I> that the excellence of Unix derives as much from the fact that it was (and continues to be) a community effort as from the fact that a lot of smart people have worked to design and build it. Raymond, best known as the author of the open-source manifesto <I>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</I>, says in his preface that this is a "why-to" book, rather than a "how-to" book. It aims to show new Unix programmers why they should work under the old "hacker ethic"--embracing the principles of good software design for its own sake and of code-sharing.  <p>  That said, a great deal of valuable practical information appears in this book. Very little of it is in the form of code; most of the practical material takes the form of case studies and discussions of aspects of Unix, all aimed at determining why particular design characteristics are good. In many cases, the people who did the work in the first place make guest appearances and explain their thinking--an invaluable resource. This book is for the deep-thinking software developer in Unix (and perhaps Linux in particular). It shows how to fit into the long and noble tradition, and how to make the software work <I>right</I>. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Why Unix (the term being defined to include Linux) is the way it is, and the people who made it that way. Commentary from Ken Thompson, Steve Johnson, Brian Kernighan, and David Korn enables readers to understand the thought processes of the creators of Unix.

review: New edition of a guide to the Free Sofware Foundation's Bourne Again Shell.  Intended both for those who are interested in bash as a user interface as well as for those who want to exploit its powerful programming capabilities.  Coverage includes shell programming, bash's advanced command-line features, installation of the shell, and configuring and customizing bash.  This edition updates information to bash version 2.0, including information on one- dimensional arrays, parameter expansion, conformity with POSIX.2 standards, security improvements, and the bash shell debugger. Book News, Inc.&#174;, Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe first thing users of the Linux operating system come face to face with is the shell.  Shell is the UNIX term for a user interface to the system -- something that lets you communicate with the computer via the keyboard and display.  Bash, the Free Software Foundation's Bourne Again Shell, is the default shell for Linux, the popular free UNIX-like operating system.  It's also a replacement for the standard UNIX Bourne shell, which serves both as a user interface and as a programming language.  Like the FSF's other tools, bash is more than a mere replacement: it extends the Bourne shell in many ways.  Features include command line editing, key bindings, integrated programming features, command completion, control structures (especially the select construct, which enables you to create menus easily), and new ways to customize your environment.  Whether you want to use bash for its user interface or its programming features you will find Learning the bash Shell a valuable guide.  The book covers all of bash's features, both for interactive use and programming.  If you are new to shell programming, Learning the bash Shell provides an excellent introduction, covering everything from the most basic to the most advanced features, like signal handling and command line processing. If you've been writing shell scripts for years, it offers a great way to find out what the new shell offers.  The book is full of examples of shell commands and programs that are designed to be useful in your everyday life as a user, not just to illustrate the feature being explained.  All of these examples are freely available to you online on the Internet.  This second edition covers all of the features of bash Version 2.0,  while still applying to bash Version 1.x. New features include the  addition of one-dimensional arrays, parameter expansion, and more  pattern-matching operations. bash 2.0 provides even more conformity  with POSIX.2 standards, and in POSIX.2 mode is completely POSIX.2 conformant.  This second edition covers several new commands, security improvements,  additions to ReadLine, improved configuration and installation, and an  additional programming aid, the bash shell debugger.  With this book you'll learn:  How to install bash as your login shellThe basics of interactive shell use, including UNIX file and directory structures, standard I/O, and background jobsCommand line editing, history substitution, and key bindingsHow to customize your shell environment without programmingThe nuts and bolts of basic shell programming, flow control structures, command-line options and typed variablesProcess handling, from job control to processes, coroutines and subshellsDebugging techniques, such as trace and verbose modesTechniques for implementing system-wide shell customization and features related to system security

review: Just as software development is an iterative process in which an application is never truly "done," the education of a developer should continue for years. You can use <I>Hardcore Java</I> as a guide to the transition from novice Java programmer to journeyman, or as a map to parts of the language you haven't explored (or explored adequately) in your development work to date. Because of those design goals, this book is something of a catch-all, covering about a dozen general topics ranging from exception-handling to nested classes (and interfaces!) and the reflection API. The coverage clearly derives from the author's "lessons learned" notes, and they're rich with information. If nothing in this book surprises you, you're probably very experienced with Java.<p>  In addition to this book's tutorial function, <I>Hardcore Java</I> puts forth and defends a number of opinions about the design and style of Java software. One example: After explaining how bit fields work--bit fields aren't widely used in Java programming, and their advantages may be interesting to some programmers--Robert Simmons points out that they're inherently limited in their ability to contain data, and that this can cause problems. This is the kind of design tradeoff that more advanced Java programmers have to consider, and Simmons does the Java community a service by showing programmers how to think critically about the capabilities of their language. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: Advanced Java topics, including final constants, collections, exception handling, and nested classes. There's a useful bit about getting customers to help you design the data models they need, and very extensive coverage of reflection.

review: Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX 2004 is the leading software tool for the creation of Web sites and other HTML interfaces. It's remarkably capable, able to deal intelligently with everything from fonts and images to JavaScript for client-side data validation and embedded Java applets. In most cases, Dreamweaver will save you time over hand-coding--and yield better-looking pages to boot. The program's learning curve, though, isn't trivial. That's why <I>Dreamweaver MX 2004: The Missing Manual</I> is worth having on hand as you learn to use Dreamweaver, and worth keeping within reach as you tackle increasingly difficult Web development work. <p>  David McFarland wrote this book, but the influence of esteemed series editor David Pogue is obvious in the careful coverage of features and frequent touches of humor (books about applications can be whangingly dull; the books in Pogue's <I>Missing Manual</I> series consistently manage to avoid this problem while maintaining comprehensiveness). The two men treat Dreamweaver's numerous features (and the even more numerous ways of putting them to use) cleverly, with a combination of procedures and side information that clarifies many oddball situations as well as straightforward conditions. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to create HTML (XHTML and CSS, strictly speaking) documents using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004. In addition to the basic stuff (text, images, links, and frames), the book shows you how to build forms for data submission and embed Flash movies and Java applets. There's also a lot of helpful emphasis on Dreamweaver's productivity features, like snippet libraries and file transfer utilities. A special section shows you how to do some server-side work with databases.

review: Simply the best System V and Solaris reference on the market today, <I>Unix in a Nutshell</I> won't steer you wrong. The book's concise style delivers the essential information on Unix, shell, and utility commands. Its command documentation is clear and complete and its examples are relevant and easy to follow.<p> Gilly starts with a complete, alphabetized listing of core Unix commands. Each entry includes a syntax summary, a clear statement of what the command does, and a full list of options, each with commentary on its function. The author then covers shell documentation, supplying details on the Bourne, Korn, and C shells and documenting each shell's commands in the standard format. Gilly also includes a section on regular expressions as they apply to grep, egrep, text editors, and various scripting languages.<p> Next, the book offers complete documentation of Emacs, ex, and vi, the powerful editors whose command structure proves perennially difficult to learn. The commands, once again, appear alphabetically with statements of their respective purposes. Other popular utilities--sed, awk, nroff, troff, tbl, and several macro languages--follow. Code managers SCCS and RCS, rarely documented in Unix books, bring up the rear.<p> Users need to know what they're looking up or they won't find this book useful. Otherwise, <I>Unix in a Nutshell</I>'s documentation is the best. <I>--David Wall</I>

review: Want to know the difference between an IDL and an ORB? <I>Teach Yourself CORBA in 14 Days</I> provides the fundamentals of CORBA, the industry standard for interoperability for distributed computing. The guide begins with a short history of distributed, client-server, and <I>n</I>-tiered models of computing and informs you where CORBA fits in. It then follows the usual format of the Teach Yourself series, organizing the material into a two-week tutorial with questions (and answers) at the end of each section.<p>Early chapters define the basics of CORBA, including the object request broker (ORB), interface definition language (IDL), and all the basic types used in this glue language, which allows objects to talk to one another in distributed environments. (A very quick tour of object design and unified modeling language is also thrown in here, but it's much too quick to do anyone much good.)<p>With the basics in tow, the author introduces sample code (written alternately in Java and C++) for a banking application and turns to more advanced topics in CORBA development. The banking application gets simple "push" features through CORBA callback functions. Another chapter discusses some pitfalls of CORBA enterprise development, with topics such as "IDL creep," the complexities of multithreading, and the lack of value semantics in CORBA IDL. This section also demonstrates how CORBA 2.0 can invoke objects dynamically through its dynamic invocation interface (DII) facility and shows how this version of CORBA has built-in support for business objects in CORBAservices and CORBAfacilities.<p>The last sections are perhaps the most useful for programmers, featuring a simple working example of a Java application that runs CORBA inside an Internet browser. The author does a good job of comparing CORBA and Java remote method invocation (RMI) and highlighting the strengths of each. Final appendices include a survey of today's CORBA tools (which are difficult to find, since these products are definitely higher-end) and a brief mention of the principal rival to CORBA--Microsoft's emerging COM+ standard. This fine introduction to CORBA development is ideal for developers or managers who want to get a perspective on the possibilities--and complexities--of using CORBA for the enterprise.

review: Push the envelope with the book that covers all the basics and branches through the more complex techniques of video and audio editing.This book is laid out in a way that focuses on some very specific topics within Premiere. Users can utilize this book as a quick reference, jumping in and getting the immediate answers. There are a few sections that apply more of a basic overtone: The reason for this is that with a program as powerful and dynamic as Premiere, with the ability to incorporate so many different media types, users need to understand how to put together and use these examples and understand how to produce a complete package, from start to finish. By analyzing the examples in this book and formulating their own versions when creating projects, users will begin to expand the capabilities they can offer clients and pick from a multitude of tools to incorporate into their next Premiere projects.From the Back Cover Push the envelope with the book that covers all the basics and branches through the more complex techniques of video and audio editing.This book is laid out in a way that focuses on some very specific topics within Premiere.

review: <I>Windows XP for Dummies</I> does a good job in its role as the flagship of the Dummies line, providing Windows novices with a guided introduction to Microsoft's latest and most feature-rich operating system for everyday computer users. Its treatment of computer, Windows, and Internet fundamentals is among the best on the market, and author Andy Rathbone has an appealing way of writing that's simultaneously fun and detail-rich. If you're a Windows novice--meaning you don't know how to undelete a file that's been sent to the Recycle Bin, or what a Web browser is, or what it means to "cut and paste" text--you will get a lot out of Rathbone's work.<p>  Some aspects of this book could be better, such as the part of the networking chapter that calls for an Ethernet hub without noting that a switch, though possibly more expensive, would do the job better, without any additional hassle. The networking coverage also does an inadequate job of explaining how to share a cable modem or DSL connection among several computers. This is a serious shortcoming, and we're getting to the point in our evolution as a society of computer users at which we can assume that everyone knows what the "Cancel" button does and would rather read about the newer, more exciting things that Windows XP can do. Even the dummies aren't <I>that</I> dumb anymore. <p>  But that said--and Rathbone does confine a lot of the really elementary stuff to a skinny introductory chapter--this book is a boon to people who aren't familiar with Windows XP or its immediate predecessors (including Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me). It's also great for people who have learned a little about Windows on the job or from their kids, and want to expand on what they know. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Microsoft Windows XP for people completely unfamiliar with the operating system and other recent versions of Windows. Coverage includes how to run programs, move and delete files, connect to the Internet, and use applications like electronic mail programs, Web browsers, and multimedia players.

review: To even try to keep pace with the rapid evolution of game development, you need a strong foundation in core programming techniques-not a hefty volume on one narrow topic or one that devotes itself to API-specific implementations. Finally, there's a guide that delivers! As a professor at the Spanish university that offered that country's first master's degree in video game creation, author Daniel Sanchez-Crespo recognizes that there's a core programming curriculum every game designer should be well versed in-and he's outlined it in these pages! By focusing on time-tested coding techniques-and providing code samples that use C++, and the OpenGL and DirectX APIs-Daniel has produced a guide whose shelf life will extend long beyond the latest industry trend. Code design, data structures, design patterns, AI, scripting engines, 3D pipelines, texture mapping, and more: They're all covered here-in clear, coherent fashion and with a focus on the essentials that will have you referring back to this volume for years to come.From the Inside FlapIf you want to understand the fundamentals of programming concepts that underlie today's games, this book leads the way. It explores such a wide range of algorithms and concepts, it should be required reading for anyone entering the game programming field.  --Alex Dunne, Executive Producer, Gamasutra.com  ...brings together material from a variety of advanced gaming topics into a single well-organized book. Wish I had something like this to refer to when I was starting out.   --Ed Magnin Video Game Designer and Programmer, Magnin & Associates  College students pursuing a degree in the field of game programming will need this book. In addition, professional programmers who wish to learn more about game-specific topics will greatly benefit from reading this book.  --Wendy Stahler, Professor and Course Director of Game Design and Development, Full Sail Real World Education  I can't think of any published book on game programming that covers this range of topics.  --Eric Le, 3D Programmer, Ubi Soft Entertainment

review: Bruce Sterling's classic work highlights the 1990 assault on hackers, when law-enforcement officials successfully arrested scores of suspected illicit hackers and other computer-based law-breakers. These raids became symbolic of the debate between fighting serious computer crime and protecting civil liberties. However, <i>The Hacker Crackdown</i> is about far more than a series of police sting operations. It's a lively tour of three cyberspace subcultures--the hacker underworld, the realm of the cybercops, and the idealistic culture of the cybercivil libertarians.<p> Sterling begins his story at the birth of cyberspace: the invention of the telephone. We meet the first hackers--teenage boys hired as telephone operators--who used their technical mastery, low threshold for boredom, and love of pranks to wreak havoc across the phone lines. From phone-related hi-jinks, Sterling takes us into the broader world of hacking and introduces many of the culprits--some who are fighting for a cause, some who are in it for kicks, and some who are traditional criminals after a fast buck. Sterling then details the triumphs and frustrations of the people forced to deal with the illicit hackers and tells how they developed their own subculture as cybercops. Sterling raises the ethical and legal issues of online law enforcement by questioning what rights are given to suspects and to those who have private e-mail stored on suspects' computers. Additionally, Sterling shows how the online civil liberties movement rose from seemingly unlikely places, such as the counterculture surrounding the Grateful Dead. <i>The Hacker Crackdown</i> informs you of the issues surrounding computer crime and the people on all sides of those issues.

review: Written by the three pioneers behind the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard, <I>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual</I> provides an excellent real-world guide to working with UML. This title provides expert knowledge on all facets of today's UML standard, helping developers who are encountering UML on the job for the first time to be more productive.<p> The book begins with a history of UML, from structured design methods of the '60s and '70s to the competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in 1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram types such as <I>class</I>, <I>use case</I>, <I>state machine</I>, <I>activity</I>, and <I>implementation</I>. (Of course, learning these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The authors use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their examples.)<p> After a tour of basic document types, <I>The Unified Modeling Language Reference Manual</I> provides an alphabetical listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence or two to several pages in length. (<I>Class</I>, <I>operation</I>, and <I>use case</I> are just a few of the important terms that are covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with software engineering principles, this reference will serve the working software developer well. As the authors note, this isn't <I>UML for Dummies</I>, but neither is it an arcane academic treatise. The authors succeed in delivering a readable reference that will answer any UML question, no matter how common or obscure. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>

review: Another in the very useful O'Reilly series, which provides solutions and how-to advice for users of specific computer technology. The focus here is on Apache--the software that currently runs over half the web sites throughout the world--and on making Apache do exactly what is needed using the various options and extensions provided as part of the package (distributed by the Apache Software Foundation). Over 150 recipes cover broad topics such as installing the software, adding modules (e.g. perl), logging, hosting multiple sites, and handling aliases, security, dynamic content (cgi-bin), and performance. Each recipe consists of a problem, solution, and discussion, with cross-references to related recipes and web links; many require less than a page, and rarely are they more than two pages. This book should be kept close by and used as a reference as questions and problems arise.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe Apache Cookbook is a collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for webmasters, web administrators, programmers, and everyone else who works with Apache.  For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or recipe-- short, focused pieces of code that you can use immediately. But this book offers more than cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.  The recipes in the Apache Cookbook range from simple tasks, such installing the server on Red Hat Linux or Windows, to more complex tasks, such as setting up name-based virtual hosts or securing and managing your proxy server. The impressive collection of useful code in this book is a guaranteed timesaver for all Apache users, from novices to advanced practitioners. Instead of poking around mailing lists, online documentation, and other sources, you can rely on the Apache Cookbook for quick solutions to common problems, and then you can spend your time and energy where it matters most.

review: How could the combination of PHP and MySQL--which is feature-rich, highly reliable combination, capable of dealing with large traffic volumes, and absolutely free of charge in most cases--be any better? In <I>MySQL/PHP Database Applications</I>, Jay Greenspan and Brad Bulger explain how to work with the capable pair, primarily for applications you might use on a Web site. If you take the time to study the advice and work through your own tests of the concepts presented, it's pretty much certain that you'll walk away with the knowledge you need to do serious development work with the PHP scripting language and the MySQL database server.<p>  Rather than make up trivial programs just to illustrate aspects of the MySQL/PHP environment, this book features code snippets, each half a page or so in length, that illustrate the behavior of key code structures. For example, in explaining conditional statements in PHP, the book gives you a no-frills IF statement with real values in place. It's not always obvious how the code structures will behave in practice, but the book does a consistently good job of commenting intelligently on the place of each aspect of the language in a well-designed application. The latter half of the book attacks specific problems--a chat system, a guest book, and so on--and walks through the setup of MySQL and each important PHP function for each. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The PHP server-side scripting language and the MySQL database server, explained for people who have neither a lot of database administration background nor programming experience. Matters of creating and querying databases, and of performing simple and advanced operations with PHP scripting, are covered adroitly.

review: Zilouchian (electrical engineering, Florida Atlantic University) and Jamshidi (engineering, University of New Mexico) are the editors of this text covering the basic concepts and applications of intelligent systems using soft computing methodologies and their integration. The contributors are active members in the field of soft computing, from several national and international university engineering departments, institutes and research labs.  The text is organized into six sections:  the fundamental concepts of neural networks (NN); the application of NN in several settings (medicine and biology, signal processing, computer networking, chemical process and oil refinery); the fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, fuzzy control and stability; applications of fuzzy logic control; evolutionary computations and their applications to several engineering problems; and a final chapter containing some examples and exercises.Book News, Inc.&#174, Portland, ORBook DescriptionIn recent years, intelligent control has emerged as one of the most active and fruitful areas of research and development. Until now, however, there has been no comprehensive text that explores the subject with focus on the design and analysis of biological and industrial applications. Intelligent Control Systems Using Soft Computing Methodologies does all that and more. Beginning with an overview of intelligent control methodologies, the contributors present the fundamentals of neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, and recurrent networks. They address various implementation issues, then explore design and verification of neural networks for a variety of applications, including medicine, biology, digital signal processing, object recognition, computer networking, desalination technology, and oil refinery and chemical processes.The focus then shifts to fuzzy logic, with a review of the fundamental and theoretical aspects, discussion of implementation issues, and examples of applications, including control of autonomous underwater vehicles, navigation of space vehicles, image processing, robotics, and energy management systems. The book concludes with the integration of genetic algorithms into the paradigm of soft computing methodologies, including several more industrial examples, implementation issues, and open problems and open problems related to intelligent control technology.Suited as both a textbook and a reference, Intelligent Control Systems explores recent advances in the field from both the theoretical and the practical viewpoints. It also integrates intelligent control design methodologies to give designers a set of flexible, robust controllers and provide students with a tool for solving the examples and exercises within the book.

review: Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student,  the new second edition of <I>Introduction to Algorithms</I> builds on  the tradition of the original with a truly magisterial guide to the  world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and  yet approachable even for the math-averse, this title sets a high  standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for  solving a wide range of computing problems.<p>With sample problems and  mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm,  this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach  doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job of explaining each  algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help  readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some math background  to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.)  Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented  in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical  approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and  common data structures, from basic linked lists to trees (including  binary trees, red-black, and B-trees), this title really shines, with  clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you just  glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit  from this text in other ways.<p>The book moves forward with more  advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more  complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy  algorithms, and amortized analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems  (used in such real-world business problems as optimizing flight  schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the  authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along  with sample solutions.<p>This text closes with a grab bag of useful  algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming,  evaluating polynomials, and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation  (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on  "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveling salesman problem,  show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best  answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can  still be used to generate useful, real-world answers.<p>Throughout this  text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current  examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome Project),  business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of  related historical material, often discussing original research in each  area of algorithms. On the whole, they argue successfully that  algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can  be used to write better software that does more, with better  performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald  Knuth's three-volume set, <I>The Art of Computer  Programming</I>), this title sets a new standard for compiling the  best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless  of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending  the range and performance of real-world software. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of algorithms (including algorithms as  a technology); designing and analyzing algorithms; asymptotic notation;  recurrences and recursion; probabilistic analysis and randomized  algorithms; heapsort algorithms; priority queues; quicksort algorithms;  linear time sorting (including radix and bucket sort); medians and  order statistics (including minimum and maximum); introduction to data  structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees); hash  tables (including hash functions); binary search trees; red-black  trees; augmenting data structures for custom applications; dynamic  programming explained (including assembly-line scheduling, matrix-chain  multiplication, and optimal binary search trees); greedy algorithms  (including Huffman codes and task-scheduling problems); amortized  analysis (the accounting and potential methods); advanced data  structures (including B-trees, binomial and Fibonacci heaps,  representing disjoint sets in data structures); graph algorithms  (representing graphs, minimum spanning trees, single-source shortest  paths, all-pairs shortest paths, and maximum flow algorithms); sorting  networks; matrix operations; linear programming (standard and slack  forms); polynomials and the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); number  theoretic algorithms (including greatest common divisor, modular  arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, RSA public-key encryption,  primality testing, integer factorization); string matching;  computational geometry (including finding the convex hull);  NP-completeness (including sample real-world NP-complete problems and  their insolvability); approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems  (including the traveling salesman problem); reference sections for  summations and other mathematical notation, sets, relations, functions,  graphs and trees, as well as counting and probability backgrounder  (plus geometric and binomial distributions).

review: Modern system-on-chip (SoC) design shows a clear trend toward integration of multiple processor cores on a single chip. Designing a multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSOC) requires an understanding of the various design styles and techniques used in the multiprocessor. Understanding the application area of the MPSOC is also critical to making proper tradeoffs and design decisions.<br><br><i>Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips</i> covers both design techniques and applications for MPSOCs. Design topics include multiprocessor architectures, processors, operating systems, compilers, methodologies, and synthesis algorithms, and application areas covered include telecommunications and multimedia. The majority of the chapters were collected from presentations made at the International Workshop on Application-Specific Multi-Processor SoC held over the past two years. The workshop assembled internationally recognized speakers on the range of topics relevant to MPSOCs. After having refined their material at the workshop, the speakers are now writing chapters and the editors are fashioning them into a unified book by making connections between chapters and developing common terminology.<br><br>*Examines several different architectures and the constraints imposed on them <br>*Discusses scheduling, real-time operating systems, and compilers <br>*Analyzes design trade-off and decisions in telecommunications and multimedia applications, Systems-on-chips are integrated circuits that implement most or all of the functions of a complete electronic system. They can be found in many product categories ranging from consumer devices to industrial systems including cell phones, television production equipment, and video games. Increasingly modern system-on-chip (SoC) design is integrating multiple processor cores on a single chip (or MPSOCs) that contain several instruction set processors. In fact, most complex SoCs are MPSoCs because they need more than one CPU to perform the application. Designing a MPSOC requires an understanding of both the various design styles and techniques used in each processor and as well as the target application area. The editors have chosen internationally recognized authors to address the needs of the MPSOC designer. They focus on multiprocessor architectures, processors, operating systems, compilers, methodologies, and synthesis algorithms.

review: This omnibus book does more than merely tell readers how to solve common CGI programming problems with the least possible hassle (which is no mean feat in itself). <I>Special Edition Using CGI</I> also explains CGI concepts and theory in a way that enables the reader to start figuring out additional solutions independently.<P> The authors begin with some very basic information about what CGI does and how it enhances HTML. Then, they promptly get into the useful stuff--application-oriented programming for CGI. Example programs written in Perl, C, SQL, and various Unix shells appear throughout the book. All the popular CGI applications, including hit counters, site searchers, WAIS interfaces, chat forums, and image maps, get their due attention. <I>Special Edition Using CGI</I> gives server-side includes (SSI) a more detailed treatment than other CGI manuals.<P> The book almost loses its focus when it starts talking about Web multimedia, including online electronic cameras and RealAudio broadcasting. But the extra material is related, albeit distantly, to CGI programming, and there's not too much of it, so you can zip along to several "tips and techniques" programming chapters. The section on Perl is useful since it covers the most popular function libraries, and the Visual Basic chapter includes an informative discussion of WinCGI. <I>Special Edition Using CGI</I> wraps up with chapters about debugging and security. There's a CD-ROM that contains all the sample programs and all the popular Perl libraries.<P> <I>Special Edition Using CGI</I> will both help you set up common CGI applications quickly and teach you how to solve more complicated CGI problems on your own. It's a great choice for the beginner with big CGI ambitions.

review: This book provides a worthwhile tour of Microsoft technologies based on DCOM and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) with plenty of advice for today's enterprise developer.<p> The book begins with Microsoft's Distributed Internet Architecture (DNA) and DNA's notion of a three-tier model for separating business objects for better scalability. Of course, COM is an important part of DNA, and the author's introduction to COM is as good as any. Coverage of database acronyms such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), ADO (ActiveX Data Objects), and OLE-DB (Object Linking and Embedding Database) round out the basics. Then the author proceeds to explain the capabilities of MTS, from using it as an object request broker (ORB) for locating remote services, to the fundamentals of transaction processing.<p> At this point, theory becomes practice, and the author walks the reader through a complete sample MTS-based application, an automated accounting package for the "Classifieds" section of a small newspaper. The author shows how to use Microsoft Visual Database Tools and provides a taste of Microsoft's software methodology called Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). After you learn how to model objects for the database and business object layers, the book helps you build them using Visual Basic and Visual C++. Finally, you learn the presentation layer, which is built using Active Server Pages (ASPs) for running inside a browser.<p> Final chapters offer material on additional Microsoft tools, such as the COM-to-mainframe tool (called COMTI) and Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ). There's also a preview of COM+--still under construction and due out with Windows 2000. In all, <I>Designing Component-Based Applications</I> successfully covers the state of the art in component development for the enterprise using the complete range of available Microsoft tools and technologies. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>

review: The <I>OpenGL Programming Guide</I>, now in its third edition, is the definitive volume for programmers using this evolving graphics interface standard. Written by members of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board, this book offers understandable tutorials and lessons on getting up to speed and getting the most out of the latest version of OpenGL, version 1.2.<p> The guide uses code examples in C and is targeted at programmers who have experience in coding yet are new to coding for OpenGL applications. The opening chapters go into descriptive detail of how OpenGL, the software interface for hardware 3-D chipsets, works and what you can expect from it, which turns out to be much more than you might have thought. Color plates are used, for example, to show how OpenGL handles such effects as motion blur and depth-of-field blur, in addition to shadows and texture mapping.<p> This is not a beginner's guide to programming computer graphics. Some previous knowledge of both programming in general and computer graphics in particular is required. For example, code snippets are used to describe how to implement these effects, but because OpenGL is platform-independent, some code examples may need to be modified when used with your specific compiler.<p> Filled with the expertise of those who standardized OpenGL, there is no better reference volume for learning and understanding this system. The examples cited are clear, commented, and explained. The only drawback to the book is that it lacks a companion CD-ROM--all examples must be either typed in or downloaded from an Internet FTP site. (The URL is listed in the preface.) <I>--Mike Caputo</I>, OpenGL is a powerful software interface for graphics hardware that allows graphics programmers to produce high-quality color images of 3D objects. The functions in the OpenGL library enable programmers to build geometric models, view models interactively in 3D space, control color and lighting, manipulate images, and perform such tasks as alpha blending, antialiasing, depth cueing, and texture mapping. <P> <B>The OpenGL Reference Manual, Second Edition</b>, documents all OpenGL functions, including brand new features recently approved by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB) for inclusion in OpenGL, Version 1.1. The ARB is an industry consortium responsible for defining OpenGL, composed of such industry leaders as Digital Equipment Corporation, Evans & Sutherland, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, Intergraph, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, and Silicon Graphics. <P> Each reference page fully describes: C specifications, relevant parameters, the effects of functions, possible errors generated by functions, associated effects, Reference pages for the OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) and the OpenGL extension to the X Window System (GLX) are included in this manual.

review: This guide shows experienced Java developers how to use Hibernate to work with information from a relational database in the form of natural Java objects. The book walks readers through initial download and configuration, then explores the software through a series of projects that demonstrate how to accomplish a variety of practical goals. The entire book is printed on pages designed to look like graph paper, with each page containing space for handwritten notes. Author information is not given.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionDo you enjoy writing software, except for the database code? Hibernate:A Developer's Notebook is for you.    Database experts may enjoy fiddling with SQL, but you don't have to--the rest of the application is the fun part. And even database experts dread the tedious plumbing and typographical spaghetti needed to put their SQL into a Java program. Hibernate: A Developers Notebook shows you how to use Hibernate to automate persistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple configuration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction between your objects and the database.  You don't even need to know the database is there, and you can change from one database to another simply by changing a few statements in a configuration file.  Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook walks you through the ins and outs of using Hibernate, from installation and configuration, to complex associations and composite types. Two chapters explore ways to write sophisticated queries, which you can express either through a pure Java API, or with an SQL-inspired, but object-oriented, query language. Don't let that intimidate you though: one of the biggest surprises in working with Hibernate is that for many of the common real-world application scenarios, you don't need an explicit query at all.    If you've needed to add a database backend to your application, don't put it off.  It's much more fun than it used to be, and Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook shows you why.  Here's what a few reviewers had to say:  I'm sitting on an airplane after finishing Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook.  It's rare to find a book on a new Java technology that you can get through on a domestic flight.  That this notebook effectively and succinctly tackles object-relational mapping makes it, and Hibernate, even more impressive.  Many books in this category would need to be checked luggage.  With this book, you travel first class. --Mike Clark  A simple persistence framework deserves a simple book, and this one delivers. The examples are well described and easy to understand, yet sophisticated enough to demonstrate Hibernate in a real-world context. Jim, I'm a new fan.  --Bruce Tate  About the new Developer's Notebook Series from O'Reilly:Developer's Notebooks are a new book series covering important new tools for software developers.  Developer's Notebooks stress example over explanation and practice over theory. They are about learning by doing; by experimenting with tools and discovering what works.  All lab, no lecture, with a thoughtful lab partner to guide the way.

review: Into the already crowded Linux desk-reference market (which threatens to  push my monitor off my desktop) comes O'Reilly's third edition of <I>Linux in a  Nutshell</I> by Ellen Siever and colleagues. The ever-expanding horizon of  Linuxology makes the editorial task of circumscribing it in a nutshell  impossible--even from the venerable O'Reilly sources. We ask, "What didn't they  cut, and do we really need it next to the coffee cup?" The success of this  attempt is spotty, at best.<p>  From agetty to znew, this Nutshell book contributes half of its contents to  alphabetically arranged synopses of 400 user, programmer, and administrator  commands and utilities. The online manual page for "ps"--the process status  program--produces over 14 screens of command-line options, environment  variables, output formatting statements, utility cross-references, and author  credits. The abstracted Nutshell entry contains only three textual pages of  command-line options and bare-bones output abbreviations.<p>  We learn that "yes" is an obscure little utility that's used ostensibly for  driving scripts like ./configure. When misused, "yes" can create a 5-MB file on  your hard drive in one CPU second; but the entry contains neither a warning to  that effect nor a description of its relationship to big brother "expect"--which  is alarming in its absence from both the alphabetical parade of commands and the  index altogether.<p>  Consequently, the first half of the book is intended for the curious and  possibly nonexistent subpopulation of well-trained users who want to remind  themselves of command-line flags, but would rather not use the online manual  pages as a reference.<p>  The meat in this Nutshell is contained sparingly in its second half. Here, it  compares favorably with online how-tos for providing technical details of Linux  kernel loading and boot parameterization, package management, bash/tcsh/csh  shell use, and the underused CVS version-control system. The technical specifics  of the popular editors emacs and vi are of marginal use to the experienced  administrator whose manual muscle memory is full. The gawk and sed tutorials are  somewhat more reference-worthy, and the tome ends with introductions to the  barely discussed gnome, JDE, and fvwm2 window managers. The gaping crack in this  book is the absence of X11 configuration guidelines, which often takes 80  percent of system configuration time, even for experienced administrators.<p>  If you can't spare a better patch of pine, you might consider wedging 75 percent  of this desk reference under your monitor, where it might contribute more to the  ergonomics of coding than to the content. The remaining 25 percent will slip  into your blotter for easy access. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: <I>Designing Active Server Pages</I> provides an important tool for  often-overworked ASP programmers: a set of techniques for making the wisest use  of the technology in a production environment. Targeting an audience of readers  who already are seasoned in ASP, author Scott Mitchell explores techniques for  producing "reusable and robust ASP applications."<p>  Presentation and example compose the approach here, with concise tables of  information and descriptions that make the book a fast read. Mitchell explores  the benefits of the VBScript 5.0 scripting engine, and illustrates how to  exploit the new RegExp object fully and build object-oriented code by using  VBScript classes--another welcome addition to the coding platform. ASP  programmers will find techniques for which they've been longing, such as  centralized error-handling pages and reusable database administration forms. <p>  Creation of and best practices for implementing COM components, useful standard  components (like the Content Linker and AdRotator), and third-party components  (such as ASPEncrypt and SA-FileUp) are discussed. <I>Designing Active Server  Pages</I> doesn't stop with mere descriptions of these components, but also  provides solutions for common needs, such as uploading files to binary fields in  Microsoft SQL Server and sending encrypted e-mail. <p>  With its advanced techniques and practical perspective, this book is perfect for  those who look to stay on the cutting edge of ASP programming. <I>--Stephen W.  Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Choosing a server-side scripting language  <li>Exception handling <li>Regular expressions <li>Building reusable forms  <li>Reusable database administration pages <li>COM overview <li>Lesser-known  Microsoft COM components <li>Important third-party COM components</ul>, Developers of Active Server Pages often reinvent the wheel. Their background in web design, with its separate HTML page for each viewable web page on a site, leads many ASP developers to create a distinct ASP page each time they think they need one. Often times, these pages are functionally similar. With intelligent planning, an ASP developer stands to save a great deal of time by creating reusable ASP pages.  <i>Designing Active Server Pages</i> is tailor-made for these developers.    There is currently a plethora of Active Server Pages books. However, the vast majority of these books are either technical references or how-to books for beginners. <i>Designing Active Server Pages</i> is written for the intermediate to advanced user. Furthermore, nearly every other book on ASP focuses on using VBScript, even though ASP supports an array of scripting languages, including JScript and PerlScript. <i>Designing Active Server Pages</i> shows how to start using these other languages.    The latest version of the scripting engines (Version 5.1 for VBScript) adds new features not available before the 5.0 release. These features include class support for VBScript, and Regular Expression searching through the use of a COM object. <i>Designing Active Server Pages</i> explains why using classes in VBScript is beneficial, and demonstrates the power of regular expression searching.    This book shows how to simplify the process by only requiring one ASP page to handle ALL of the Forms throughout a web site, thus reducing the amount of code one has to write.    Topics include:    <ul><li>Using various Microsoft and third-party components to enhance ASP pages</li>  <li>Creating components using VB and/or VC++</li>  <li>Sample code for performing routine ASP tasks</li>  <li>Techniques to allow for reusable database scripts on the database system and on ASP pages</li>  <li>How to obtain and register third-party components, thus saving massive amounts of time by reusing someone else's code</li></ul>    <i>Designing Active Server Pages</i> is for developers who have already mastered the basics of ASP application development and are ready to take the next logical step. It is sure to become an indispensable part of every web developer's library.

review: Despite C++'s syntactic similarities to C, the two languages are fundamentally different in nature--a fact that can complicate the task of learning C++ if you already know C. <I>Thinking in C++</I> explains C++ to C programmers not just from the perspective of writing code, but from the perspective of software engineering and design--how do you conceptualize programs that exploit C++'s capabilities? With readable prose, Bruce Eckel offers a compelling explanation of what object-oriented languages in general and C++ in particular have to offer and teaches you how to apply it. The book covers not only introductory topics but advanced ones such as multiple inheritance and templates.

review: The Universal Serial Bus (USB) specification is a boon for users in that it makes the process of connecting peripherals to computers effortless, in most cases. As is often the case with user-friendliness, though, the cosmetic ease comes about as a result of behind-the-scenes complexity. <I>USB Design by Example</I> explains what USB means to hardware developers, taking an approach that combines academic elucidation of the official specification with some experimental setups. Though not everything a hardware developer could wish for, John Hyde's explanations represent a valuable supplement to the notably obtuse specification documents.<p> This book does a good job of explaining USB input/output from both the hardware and software perspectives. You'll find both driver code and pinout diagrams here. All the software information has to do with the IBM-compatible PC platform and the Windows 98 operating system, so Macintosh developers will have to look elsewhere. Some of Hyde's explanations of how various hardware companies solved USB problems--Symbol Technologies' use of a keyboard emulator for its barcode scanners, for example--are intriguing, but more information (in the form of circuit diagrams, preferably) would be better. The clear explanation of what happens when a new device is plugged into a live USB bus is very intriguing, though. Overall, peripheral developers will find this book useful, but not encyclopedic. <I>--David Wall</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Universal Serial Bus (USB) architecture, packet contents, device detection, drivers and run-time software, and bridging older connection specifications (RS-232, parallel, SCSI and I2C) to USB., This unique guide goes beyond all the Universal Serial Bus (USB) specification overviews to provide you with the expert knowledge and skills you need to design and implement USB I/O devices. It is organized around a series of fully documented, real-world examples, and is structured to serve as both a step-by-step guide for creating specific devices and a complete reference to USB. Design examples cover most USB classes (HID, communications, audio, mass-storage and hub) and provide insights into high-speed USB 2.0 devices, including a definition and a device driver for a vendor class, called blockio.    <P>Intel insider John Hyde:  <UL> <LI>Provides examples, complete with schematics and source code, that gradually increase in complexity  <LI>Describes many vendor solutions and shows how to pick the ones best suited to your project needs  <LI>Explains how to design a vast array of devices, including data acquisition, audio, video and computer-telephony examples  </UL> The CD-ROM contains:  <UL> <LI>Source code and project files for all the examples in the book (PC Host and I/O device)  <LI>Evaluation versions of design and debug tools  <LI>The USB specification and supporting class and test documents  <LI>Categorized links to other USB solution suppliers </UL>

review: To help you design Microsoft database servers that must achieve the best possible performance, <I>Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2000</I> has the details you need. For one thing, author Kalen Delaney (who used Ron Soukup's fantastic first edition as a starting point) explains how SQL Server 2000 works at a level that will interest all database administrators. She packs in the sort of minutiae that can make a real difference in the performance of especially large or complex data-storage structures, explaining what goes on inside the database management system (DBMS) when it's presented with various commands, and using that information to back up her abundant advice on the right way to design, build, and operate databases under SQL Server 2000.<p>  Delaney makes extensive use of DBCC PAGE dumps to show what's going on in the databases that demonstrate concepts (incidentally, that utility is documented, as well as the others in the DBCC toolbox). In a typical section, DBCC PAGE is used to show how index pages work. There's careful attention to database structure at the byte level too, with conceptual diagrams that explain how pointers work and how strings of strings of bytes combine to represent stored data. It's the sort of detail you need if you'll be writing software for SQL Server 2000, or need to extract maximum performance from the DBMS itself. <I>--David Wall</I><p>   <B>Topics covered:</B> Microsoft SQL Server 2000 internals, especially data structures and the behavior of queries. Table design is emphasized, especially indexing decisions. Transact-SQL programming, including the use of cursors, gets lots of attention.

review: Written for developers already using .NET and familiar with C#, this book introduces the XML standards and the .NET assembly that implements the technology, explains when it's appropriate to use each technology, and provides examples that illustrate how to use the assemblies.  The last third of the book is an API reference that describes each namespace, its types, and their members.  Topics include XmlReader, XmlWriter, the document object model, XPath, XSLT, SOAP, ADO.NET, and web services.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIf you're seeking ways to build network-based applications or XML-based web services, Microsoft provides most of the tools you'll need. XML is integrated into the .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET, but if you want to get a grasp on how .NET and XML actually work together, that's a different story.  With .NET & XML, you can get under the hood to see how the .NET Framework implements XML, giving you the skills to write understandable XML-based code that interoperates with code written with other tools, and even other languages.   .NET & XML starts by introducing XML and the .NET Framework, and then teaches you how to read and write XML before moving on to complex methods for manipulating, navigating, transforming, and constraining it. As you move from chapter to chapter, you'll absorb increasingly complex information until you have enough knowledge to successfully program your own XML-based applications. This tutorial also contains a quick reference to the API, plus various useful appendices.

review: In the world of Unix operating systems, the various BSDs come with a long heritage of high-quality software and well-designed solutions, making them a favorite OS of a wide range of users. Among budget-minded users who adopted BSD early on to developers of some of today's largest Internet sites, the popularity of BSD systems continues to grow.  If you use the BSD operating system, then you know that the secret of its success is not just in its price tag: practical, reliable, extraordinarily stable and flexible, BSD also offers plenty of fertile ground for creative, time-saving tweaks and tricks, and yes, even the chance to have some fun.  Fun? you ask.  Perhaps fun wasn't covered in the manual that taught you to install BSD and administer it effectively.

review: Biology, it seems, is a good showcase for the talents of Perl. Newcomers to Perl who understand biological information will find James Tisdall's <I>Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics</I> to be an excellent compendium of examples. Teachers of Perl will likewise find the text to be filled with fresh programming illustrations of growing scientific importance. Seasoned Perlmongers who want to learn biology, however, should search elsewhere, as Tisdall's emphasis is on Perl's logic rather than Mother Nature's.<p>  Departing from O'Reilly's earlier monograph <I>Developing Bioinformatic Computer Skills</I>, Tisdall's text is organized aggressively along didactic lines. Nearly all of the 13 chapters begin with twin bullet lists of Perl programming tools and the bioinformatic methods that require them. Likewise, the chapters end with exercises. String concatenation is illustrated with gene splicing, and regular expressions are taught with gene transcription and motif searching.<p>  Tisdall emphasizes sequence examples throughout, leading up to an introduction to a Perl interface for the NIH GenBank biological database and the widely used BLAST sequence alignment tool. After a brief discussion of three-dimensional protein structure, he returns to sequence extraction and secondary structure prediction.<p>  Tisdall's goal is to boost the beginning programmer into a domain of self-learning. He imparts essential etiquette for the success of programming newbies: use the wealth or resources available, from user documentation to Web site surveys to FAQs to How-To's to news groups and finally to direct personal appeals for help from a senior colleague. A well-plugged-in bioinformatics Perl student will soon discover Bioperl, an open-source effort to bring research-grade bioinformatic tools to the Perl community. Bioperl is described briefly at the end of Tisdall's book and will reportedly be a forthcoming title of its own in the O'Reilly bioinformatics series.<p>  Although he introduces bioinformatics as an academic discipline, Tisdall treats it as a trade throughout his book. He indicates that open questions and computational hard problems exist, but does not describe what they are or how they are being tackled. Ultimately, Tisdall presents bioinformatics as another arrow in a bench scientist's quiver, very much like HPLC, 2D-PAGE, and the various spectroscopies.<p>  As odd as a "bioinformatics-as-tool" book may be to its research proponents, the reduction of bioinformatics to trade status both deflates and vindicates the years of research, as Tisdall's work attests. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: Iverson, a seasoned practitioner, helps to nail down the very definition of web services, examines current and future applications, describes the features of some real-world applications, and gives a series of eight projects such as competitive analysis, auctions and shipping (as in eBay's successful application), searching, news gathering, and conferencing. He provides plenty of sample code and takes a shot at describing what is to come for developers and their projects.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe core idea behind Real World Web Services is simple: after years of hype, what are the major players really doing with web services? Standard bodies may wrangle and platform vendors may preach, but at the end of the day what are the technologies that are actually in use, and how can developers incorporate them into their own applications?  Those are the answers Real World Web Services delivers. It's a field guide to the wild and wooly world of non-trivial deployed web services.   The heart of the book is a series of projects, demonstrating the use and integration of Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and many more web services. Some of these vendors have been extremely successful with their web service deployments: for example, eBay processes over a billion web service requests a month!    The author focuses on building 8 fully worked out example web applications that incorporate the best web services available today.  The book thoroughly documents how to add functionality like automating listings for auctions, dynamically calculating shipping fees, automatically sending faxes to your suppliers, using an aggregator to pull data from multiple news and web service feeds into a single format or monitoring the latest weblog discussions and Google searches to keep web site visitors on top of topics of interest-by integrating APIs from popular websites most people are already familiar with.  For each example application, the author provides a thorough overview, architecture, and full working code examples.  This book doesn't engage in an intellectual debate as to the  correctness  of web services on a theological level.  Instead, it focuses on the practical, real world usage of web services as the latest evolution in distributed computing, allowing for structured communication via Internet protocols.  As you ll see, this includes everything from sending HTTP GET commands to retrieving an XML document through the use of SOAP and various vendor SDKs.

review: Large IT organizations increasingly face the challenge of integrating various web services, applications, and other technologies into a single network.  The solution to finding a meaningful large-scale architecture that is capable of spanning a global enterprise appears to have been met in ESB, or Enterprise Service Bus.  Rather than conform to the hub-and-spoke architecture of traditional enterprise application integration products, ESB provides a highly distributed approach to integration, with unique capabilities that allow individual departments or business units to build out their integration projects in incremental, digestible chunks, maintaining their own local control and autonomy, while still being able to connect together each integration project into a larger, more global integration fabric, or grid.  Enterprise Service Bus offers a thorough introduction and overview for systems architects, system integrators, technical project leads, and CTO/CIO level managers who need to understand, assess, and evaluate this new approach. Written by Dave Chappell, one of the best known and authoritative voices in the field of enterprise middleware and standards-based integration, the book drills down into the technical details of the major components of ESB, showing how it can utilize an event-driven SOA to bring a variety of enterprise applications and services built on J2EE, .NET, C/C++, and other legacy environments into the reach of the everyday IT professional.   With Enterprise Service Bus, readers become well versed in the problems faced by IT organizations today, gaining an understanding of how current technology deficiencies impact business issues. Through the study of real-world use cases and integration patterns drawn from several industries using ESB--including Telcos, financial services, retail, B2B exchanges, energy, manufacturing, and more--the book clearly and coherently outlines the benefits of moving toward this integration strategy.  The book also compares ESB to other integration architectures, contrasting their inherent strengths and limitations.   If you are charged with understanding, assessing, or implementing an integration architecture, Enterprise Service Bus will provide the straightforward information you need to draw your conclusions about this important disruptive technology. From the AuthorA note to book reviewer P. Pant, who wrote the negative comments about Java in your review that is posted below &#150; I really appreciate that you point out that the book is extremely well written. However, it appears that you have missed some key points in your reading of the book. An ESB is all about heterogeneity, therefore Java technology is a useful thing to be able to integrate with when using an ESB.   JMS, for example, is a well established standard for messaging, with broad industry support. It is one of the MANY ways to integrate with other applications through an ESB. I don&#146;t mention it any more or any less than other standard technologies like XPath or XSLT. In fact, I have an entire chapter on Message Oriented Middleware which generically discusses MOM concepts such as store-and-forward messaging. At the end of the chapter is a small section on JMS and another equal amount of ink devoted to WS-Reliability and WS-ReliableMessaging. The final chapter, BTW is about how ESB&#146;s and the Web Services stack of specifications (many of which I am co-author of) are going to evolve together.   Lastly, I appreciate that you have correctly recognized that the concepts outlined nicely complement Hohpe's book on intergation patterns in my view. I worked with Gregor Hohpe during the writing of this book to ensure that the readers of both books would have a consistent visual metaphor when describing integration patterns. Dave

review: It is easy to foresee that this book will become a classic. -- Fabrizio Sebastiani, The Computer JournalBook DescriptionReasoning about knowledge -- particularly the knowledge of agents who reason about the world and each other's knowledge -- was once the exclusive province of philosophers and puzzle solvers. More recently, this type of reasoning has been shown to play a key role in a surprising number of contexts, from understanding conversations to the analysis of distributed computer algorithms.  Reasoning About Knowledge is the first book to provide a general discussion of approaches to reasoning about knowledge and its applications to distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and game theory. It brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable. The book is almost completely self-contained and should be accessible to readers in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, cognitive science, and game theory. Each chapter includes exercises and bibliographic notes.

review: Aimed at the more experienced Java developer, <I>Building Java Enterprise Applications</I> provides a detailed tour of the best practices for today's J2EE architecture. Filled with particularly good advice on using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) and LDAP directory services, this title lays the groundwork for building the next generation of Java software.<p>As volume one of a planned three-volume series, this book centers on "blueprints" for using the best of J2EE technologies for creating scalable software. The focus here is on a meaningful, single practical case study on a database for a brokerage house. The selection of leading-edge technologies (EJB and LDAP) are what real Java developers are likely to face on the job, and the author's knowledgeable and thorough explanation of all the relevant details of implementing the sample system sets a high standard.<p>Early sections define the scope and requirements of the model database and directory server. The author then turns to implementing the database, including building tables. (Actual SQL for different databases including Oracle and MySQL is included in an appendix.) Similarly, the "real" details of modeling a directory server (using LDAP) is set out to show how users, passwords, and other information can be leveraged across a larger organization. After the groundwork is in place, this text zeroes in on using Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 2.0 to model each business entity in the system (as well as application logic). Standout material shows off building an entity EJB with multiple interfaces, classes, and deployment descriptors all clearly presented.<p>The use of the manager session bean to hide the details of JNDI and LDAP comes next, and this bit of intellectual property will surely justify the price of this book for anyone seeking to combine EJBs and LDAP. From here, the application logic gets filled in using other EJB features (like session beans, both stateful and stateless). A later chapter adds asynchronous processing abilities using the Java Message Service (JMS) and the new message bean type, new for EJB 2.0. The assembled system then gets a simple front end to test it out, though the focus clearly is on the data tier. (More on user interfaces is promised in the second volume of this series, which will concentrate on Web applications.)<p>Useful appendices provide the  nuts and bolts of running actual software, like OpenLDAP, a free directory server, BEA WebLogic, plus full source code for all beans discussed in this text. All in all, this book is a worthwhile choice for understanding the right ways for designing on the Java platform today when it comes to higher-end enterprise software.  <I>--Richard Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Introduction to architecture for Java Enterprise applications; case study for a client/broker database for a brokerage with scheduling support, data, business, and presentation layers explained; primer for database design (including SQL, constraints, and tables); designing an LDAP directory (plus directory hierarchies); Enterprise JavaBean 2.0 basics (remote, local, and local home interfaces, plus primary keys); EJB deployment descriptors; implementing sequences for new records in EJBs (a sequence bean); using a manager EJB for JNDI/LDAP processing; connection sharing for performance; adding sample data; deployment; using patterns for business logic with EJBs (the Facade pattern); stateful vs. stateless beans; asynchronous processing and message beans (including JMS basics); extending the data architecture for Web applications (and Web services); appendices for sample SQL scripts and database-specific hints for MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL; and a reference to running OpenLDAP, iPlanet Directory Server, and BEA WebLogic Application Server.

review: The first third of <I>Developing Intranet Applications with Java</I> isn't strictly about Java. Rather, it's about intranets, with some information about Java development environments and code style. (The author has some novel ideas about pretty-printing.) This may be a selling point for those who have been called upon to set up an intranet and implement Java programs on it all at once; others may consider it filler material.<p> The cool thing in <I>Developing Intranet Applications with Java</I> is that author Jerry Ablan has put together custom software for both the book and its accompanying CD-ROM. The Java Intranet Framework (JIF) is a set of classes you can use as a base for writing corporate intranet tools. In fact, Ablan goes into great detail about using the JIF to write a conference tool, a benefits-management tool, the electronic equivalent of a magnetic in/out board, a product maintenance tracker, and several other tools. It's interesting to see how the JIF facilitates these products and how you can expand upon them. If you want to see, in detail, how one programmer created a suite of intranet tools, this book is the one for you.

review: <div>Now in its third edition, this developer's guide to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface covers all aspects of project development, including device programming and host application software. This book shows how to transform the information in the USB 3.0 specifications into functioning devices and application software that communicates with the devices. To help build a foundation for design decisions, developers are guided in selecting device-controller hardware. Developers will also learn the benefits of the USB interface, its limitations, and how certain design choices made at the beginning of the project can reduce development time. Recent developments in host and device hardware, more detail on the standard USB classes, application examples using Microsoft's .NET Framework, and information on developing dual-role devices using USB On-The-Go is provided in detail.<br></div>, Every Windows 98 and Windows 2000 computer contains Universal Serial Bus ports for connecting to a variety of peripherals. This guide takes the pain out of designing for this popular interface with specific, detailed examples that show how to develop USB devices and the applications that communicate with them. How the USB communicates with the PC, deciding if a project should use a USB interface, choosing a USB controller chip for peripheral design, and determining code which USB peripherals need to communicate with Windows applications are covered in detail. Reflecting the changes in the newly released USB 2.0 standard, this book also includes a complete project that shows how to develop a custom USB peripheral from start to finish.

review: In recognition of the growing requirement for Distributed  Transaction Processing (DTP), X/Open defined a model for DTP. This  model envisions three software components in a DTP system and this  specification defines the interface between two of them, the  transaction manager and local resource manager. An XA+ Specification,  Version 2 (S423) is a superset of XA which includes the communications  resource manager. We recommend that both documents be examined and  compared.

review: The suite of utility applications that Unix users and administrators find indispensable--Telnet, rlogin, FTP, and the rest--can in fact prove to be the undoing of interconnected systems. The Secure Shell, a.k.a. SSH (which isn't a true shell at all) provides your otherwise attack-prone utilities with the protection they need. <I>SSH: The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</I> explains how to use SSH at all levels. In a blended sequence, the book explains what SSH is all about, how it fits into a larger security scheme, and how to employ it as an everyday user with an SSH client. More technically detailed chapters show how to configure a SSH server--several variants are covered--and how to integrate SSH with non-Unix client platforms.<p>  As befits its detail- and variation-rich subject, this book comprises many specialized sections, each dealing with some specific aspect of use or configuration (setting up access control at the account level, for example, or generating keys for a particular SSH server). The writing is both informative and fun to read; the authors switch back and forth between text and entry-and-response listings from SSH machines. They often run through a half-dozen or more variants on the same command in a few pages, providing the reader with lots of practical information. The discussion of how SSH fits into a Kerberos Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is great, as is the advice on defeating particular kinds of attacks. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>The Secure Shell (SSH) for installers, administrators, and everyday users <li>SSH design and operation <li>Server setup <li>SSH agents <li>Client configuration <li>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration <li>SSH1 <li>SSH2 <li>F-Secure <li>OpenSSH for Unix <li>SSH1 and SecureCRT for Microsoft Windows <li>NiftyTelnet SSH for Mac OS</ul>

review: Your digital camera is more than new incarnation of your old film camera. Yes, it still produces photos, but it also offers new outlets for creativity, including instant gratification of seeing your photos now, the ability to experiment without worrying about expense, the technology to fine-tune your photos with advanced professional techniques, and the means to share your work instantaneously with anyone, anyplace in the world.  It's no wonder that digital cameras are outselling traditional cameras for the first time ever. But the question most digital camera users ask is this, How do I get from taking 'decent' photos to doing the things I'd really like to do? How do I tap into that potential?  Digital Photography Hacks is your passport to taking the kind of digital photos you've always aspired to.  Written by Derrick Story, photographer and author of Digital Photography Pocket Guide and other books, it goes beyond the standard fare of most digital photography books--such as camera basics, understanding memory cards, and when to use a flash--to the things that professional photographers have learned through thousands of shots' worth of experience, years of experimentation, and fiddling and hacking.  The book includes a foreword by photographer  Rick Smolan, author of America 24/7.  With exquisite, full-color photos throughout, the book presents a collection of tips, tricks, and techniques for photographers ready to move beyond the basics.  And if you don't have the latest in digital camera photography, this book will show you how to extend the life and functionality of your existing camera.  All the hacks in the book are platform-agnostic, designed for use on both Mac on Windows-based computers. You'll find 100 proven techniques in the areas of:Daytime and nighttime photo secretsFlash magicDigital camera attachmentsThe computer connectionPhotoshop magicFun photo projectsCamera phone tricksThis book is for the photographer you are now, and the one you want to be. Digital Photography Hacks is for the creative adventurer who resides in each of us.

review: Identifies the vulnerable points of wireless systems in an interference- and distortion-based environment, and presents techniques for mitigating the effects of interference.  Stavroulakis (electrical engineering, Technical University of Crete) develops a methodology that involves quantifying the parameters of the wireless system that play a major role in the design, characterizing the channel that will be used, and defining the transmission system to be implemented, then analyzing the additive or multiplicative nature of the interfering signals.  The last chapter describes several interference cancelers, including the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) scheme, the indirect cochannel interference canceler (ICIC), and the orthogonalizing matched filter (OMF).Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThis leading-edge resource offers you a new methodology for analyzing and studying the behavior of wireless communication systems in an interference environment. It provides you with modern tools and techniques for use in real-world applications that help you guarantee optimum system performance. The book treats both additive and multiplicative interfering signals, including in-depth descriptions of how these signals behave, regardless of the source.  Hands-on details are provided to help you categorize and quantify interference agents in communications; to assist you in identifying design parameters of wireless systems which affect and can be affected by interference; to design and develop quality metrics of wireless systems in an interference environment; develop new interference suppression and mitigation techniques; and to design practical interference cancellers for wireless systems. Over 300 equations and 80 illustrations support key topics throughout the book.

review: The Linux operating system has made a lot of progress in the past few years, and <I>Running Linux</I> has progressed right along with it to remain the single best general-purpose book for curious computer users who want to install, use, and enjoy Linux. The team of authors present a text that's simultaneously detailed and readable. Coupled with an inquisitive and capable reader, that's a recipe for success with the world's most popular open-source operating system. This new edition adds coverage of the GNOME desktop environment, the Apache/MySQL/PHP server suite, and the Postfix mail transfer daemon. It also covers core capabilities and behaviors of Linux through kernel version 2.4. There's better coverage of network security (including firewalling and ADSL link configuration), and coverage of how to set up audio-related hardware and software.<p>Perhaps best of all, this book conveys a sense of the "Linux attitude" as the authors see it. Linux, they say, is largely about experimentation, research, trial and error, and participation in a community. This comes in welcome contrast to books that focus on recipes (follow these steps to accomplish A; do these things to make your system do B). Though the authors of this book provide lots of how-to information, it's always presented with an eye toward further exploration. In explaining how to build the kernel, for example, the authors provide six concise steps as a reference, but then go on for several pages about designing makefiles and how to deal with error messages. This book's a treat. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Assuming you know next to nothing about Linux, socially and historically as well as technically, this book teaches you what you need to know to make the operating system meet your desktop and server computing requirements. Coverage takes you from preparing to install Linux (in a multi-OS environment if you wish), continues through system administration and the most useful applications (like TeX and Internet clients), and proceeds to cover programming tools and server daemons (notably Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The coverage is mostly generic, but peculiarities of Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian get attention, too.

review: Today's web sites have moved far beyond brochureware. They are larger and more complex, have great strategic value to their sponsors, and their users are busier and less forgiving. Designers, information architects, and web site managers are required to juggle vast amounts of information, frequent changes, new technologies, and sometimes even multiple objectives, making some web sites look like a fast-growing but poorly planned city-roads everywhere, but impossible to navigate.  Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, 2nd Edition, shows you how to blend aesthetics and mechanics for distinctive, cohesive web sites that work. Most books on web development concentrate on either the graphics or the technical issues of a site. This book focuses on the framework that holds the two together.  By applying the principles outlined in this completely updated classic, you'll build web sites and intranets that are easier to navigate and appealing to your users, as well as scalable and simple to maintain.From the Inside FlapPraise for Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, 2nd Edition  It's been well worth the wait!  This much expanded second version provides a holistic perspective on information architecture &#150; something that wasn't possible earlier on when the concept was just beginning to be raised in the web space.  It will be the starting place and the core reference resource for practicing and future information architects, as well as their managers.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make their ideas become real, and most importantly, of value to their end-user community. -- Mary Lee Kennedy, Microsoft  In the first edition, Lou and Peter examined the emergence of a new species of technical professional -- the IA. In this second edition, they expose the complex electronic ecosystem in which IA now exist. With wit, wisdom, and a pinch of whimsy, they give you what you need to be or work with an architect of the wired world.  -  Bob Boiko, Lecturer, University of Washington iSchool & President, Metatorial Services Inc.  What's big and throbbing? Your headache. It's caused by the uncontrollable flood of web pages that you have to deal with, day after day. The pain you feel is the result of a web site that lacks structure and is getting more and more out of control. You want relief? The 2nd Edition of Information Architecture for the World Wide Web is the cure. -- John S. Rhodes, WebWord.com -- Industrial Strength Usability  The world will be a better place when web designers read this book. It's smart, funny, and artfully distills years of the authors' hard-won experience. Information Architecture is unlike any other book on web design I know in that it tackles political/organizational challenges as well as content, structure and user interface. This is not design-lite, but a deep treatment of fundamental issues of information presentation that advances the state of the art. Light years ahead of the competition.  -- Bonnie Nardi, co-author of Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart, MIT Press, 1999.  If you are developing large-scale Web sites with a complex information architecture, this book will explain everything you need. Rosenfeld and Morville define the art and science of information architecture. This book is beneficial for both the novice or the experienced professional. Once again, Rosenfeld and Morville have written the Bible of information architecture. This book should be on every Web developer's bookshelf. -Cameron Barrett,  Design Technologist, camworld.com  Clearly written, a powerful use of simple metaphors to make complex points.  Restores information management to its rightful place in management thinking.  -  Dave Snowden,  Director of the Cynefin Centre for Organisational Complexity IBM Global Services  Perhaps the only good thing about the dot.com bust is that it finally gave Lou [Rosenfeld] and Peter [Morville] time to finish their long awaited second edition of THE best book on Web design.  As a reward for our patience, they've added tons of things they've learned in the intervening years, expanding it into the definitive book on Information Architecture. If you build Web sites, you need a copy on your bookshelf. - Steve Krug, Author of Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability  In this definitive text for the emerging profession of information architecture, Rosenfeld and Morville provide a wealth of experience-based examples and guidance for practitioners and students alike. &#150; Gary Marchionini, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

review: The new edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel.  Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine.  Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does.    The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added.  You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments.  If knowledge is power, then this book will help you make the most of your Linux system.

review: Practical RDF explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects.    The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML.  If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, Practical RDF is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF.

review: Currently, XML is a bubbling cauldron of expectations and implementations. In <I>XML in Action</I>, William J. Pardi gives you a feel for what Microsoft is throwing into the mix by providing a general introduction to XML, with a focus on Internet Explorer 5.0's implementation in particular.<p> Not surprisingly, the book opens up with a discussion of markup languages, the need for an extensible solution such as XML, and a taste for some of the associated languages currently critical to XML. The text then moves into the structure of XML documents, presenting the many XML terms and explaining how Document Type Definition (DTD) enforces the rules that govern XML implementations.<p> The book illustrates how to script XML and how to use it to build data structures--a major advantage of XML and an important skill for Web developers. The author also discusses the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), a special formatting dialect for use with XML, and the special linking capabilities of XML, focusing on Xlink and Xpointer. Pardi illustrates several other advanced aspects of XML and documents the XML Object Model. A companion CD includes e-text of the book, content, and code samples and links to XML resources online. While this title is written through the eyes of Microsoft, it provides an excellent introduction to the possibilities and realities of XML. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I>

review: <P><STRONG>Quality of Telephone-Based Spoken Dialogue Systems</STRONG> is a systematic overview of assessment, evaluation, and prediction methods for the quality of services such as travel and touristic information, phone-directory and messaging, or telephone-banking services. A new taxonomy of quality-of-service is presented which serves as a tool for classifying assessment and evaluation methods, for planning and interpreting evaluation experiments, and for estimating quality. A broad overview of parameters and evaluation methods is given, both on a system-component level and for a fully integrated system. Three experimental investigations illustrate the relationships between system characteristics and perceived quality. The resulting information is needed in all phases of system specification, design, implementation, and operation.</P> <P><STRONG>Although Quality of Telephone-Based Spoken Dialogue Systems</STRONG> is written from the perspective of an engineer in telecommunications, it is an invaluable source of information for professionals in signal processing, communication acoustics, computational linguistics, speech and language sciences, human factor design and ergonomics</P>

review: Learn from the LEGO Masters!  While many LEGO books exist that show step-by-step instructions, they lack substantially detailed explanations about the building techniques used by the authors and the general concepts that are fundamental to the projects. These reflections are the foundation of LEGO MINDSTORMS Masterpieces. The goal of this book is to present very sophisticated projects with the maximum level of detail. In the book you hold in your hands you will find not only high quality step-by-step instructions for building all of the robots, but also a complete description for each of them, including goals, building techniques, programming techniques, and the theory supporting the designer&#146;s choices.Book InfoText presents very sophisticated projects with the maximum level of detail. Includes step-by-step instructions for building robots: a complete description of each of them, including goals, building techniques, programming techniques, and the theory supporting the designer's choices. CD-ROM includes complete RCX and NQC Code Files, and movies of robots in action. Softcover.

review: <P><STRONG>Wireless Optical Communication Systems</STRONG> addresses the problem of designing efficient signalling and provides a link between the areas of communication theory and modem design for amplitude constrained linear optical intensity channel. Topics include historical perspective, channel impairments, amplitude constraints and the characteristics of popular optoelectronic components. A variety of wireless optical channel topologies are presented along with a survey and analysis of present day signalling techniques employed for these channels. The author provides a unifying framework for signalling design which allows the channel constraints to be represented geometrically and permits the use of modem design principles from electrical channels. Modulation schemes are designed using the formalism of lattice codes and a design process for signalling sets is specified. </P> <P>The use of multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) wireless optical channels to improve the spectral efficiency of links is explored. The basic spatio-temporal modem design problem is specified and a spatial multiplexing gain is quantified. New spatial discrete multitone modulation is proposed and the unique features are discussed. Based on measurements on an experimental prototype, a channel model is formulated and a realizable spatio-temporal coding scheme is simulated to quantify performance gains. </P> <P>This volume is organized for professional and academic readers engaged in modem design for wireless optical intensity channels. Significant background material is presented on both the properties as well as on fundamental communications principles. <STRONG>Wireless Optical Communication Systems</STRONG> can be used by physicists and experimentalists as an introduction to signalling design as well as communication systems designers.</P>

review: McCarty (information technology, Azusa Pacific University) provides step-by-step instructions for installing and initially configuring security enhanced Linux (SELinux) on several popular Linux distributions, explains the basic user administration tasks, and describes the process of writing and revising policies. He introduces the syntax of policy files, discusses the directives that relate to user roles, and illustrates how to adjust SELinux systems to users' needs.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe intensive search for a more secure operating system has often left everyday, production computers far behind their experimental, research cousins. Now SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) dramatically changes this.  This best-known and most respected security-related extension to Linux embodies the key advances of the security field.  Better yet, SELinux is available in widespread and popular distributions of the Linux operating system--including for Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE--all of it free and open source.  SELinux emerged from research by the National Security Agency and implements classic strong-security measures such as role-based access controls, mandatory access controls, and fine-grained transitions and privilege escalation following the principle of least privilege. It compensates for the inevitable buffer overflows and other weaknesses in applications by isolating them and preventing flaws in one application from spreading to others. The scenarios that cause the most cyber-damage these days--when someone gets a toe-hold on a computer through a vulnerability in a local networked application, such as a Web server, and parlays that toe-hold into pervasive control over the computer system--are prevented on a properly administered SELinux system.  The key, of course, lies in the words properly administered. A system administrator for SELinux needs a wide range of knowledge, such as the principles behind the system, how to assign different privileges to different groups of users, how to change policies to accommodate new software, and how to log and track what is going on. And this is where SELinux is invaluable. Author Bill McCarty, a security consultant who has briefed numerous government agencies, incorporates his intensive research into SELinux into this small but information-packed book. Topics include:A readable and concrete explanation of SELinux concepts and the SELinux security modelInstallation instructions for numerous distributionsBasic system and user administrationA detailed dissection of the SELinux policy languageExamples and guidelines for altering and adding policiesWith SELinux, a high-security computer is within reach of any system administrator. If you want an effective means of securing your Linux system--and who doesn't?--this book provides the means.

review: With this tutorial, you will explore all aspects of using .NET Windows Forms class libraries and the associated programming tools in Visual Studio .NET, enabling you to build applications for the Windows 9x, Windows 2000 and Windows XP desktop platforms. Step-by-step, you'll learn ways to design applications that either function alone on a PC, or work in combination with your web-based application server to take advantage of the richer interface and higher level of security.   The book also explains how your new Windows applications can sidestep problems that used to arise from the use of DLLs (known collectively as DLL hell), and how .NET Windows Forms can be used as an alternative to ASP.NET and browser-based approaches for building web application clients.  Jesse Liberty definitely knows his stuff when it comes to the .NET platform. As the author of O'Reilly's Programming C# and Learning Visual Basic .NET, he's well-known for his clear and concise style that prompted one reviewer to say, It's as if he knows exactly what questions I'm going to ask ahead of time.

review: Mac OS X Hacks reflects the real-world know how and experience of those well steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs: System Preferences, GUI mods and tweaks, hardware tips, vital shareware and freeware, AppleScript, AppleTalk and equivalents, keyboard modifiers, and general Macintosh-style tomfoolery.  Each Hack can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer.  Mac OS X Hacks provides direct, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing both those meeting the Mac for the first time and long-time users delving into Mac OS X and its Unix underpinnings  Mac OS X Hacks is the third in O'Reilly's new Hacks Series that aims to begin reclaiming the term hacking for the good guys.  In recent years, the term has come to be associated with those nefarious black hats who break into computers to snoop, steal information or disrupt Internet traffic.  But the term originally had a more benign meaning, and you'll still hear it used this way whenever developers get together.   Our new Hacks books are written in the spirit of the true hackers -- the people who drive innovation.

review: Chamberlain, a software engineer, introduces the Perl Template Toolkit, a presentation management system that can be used for web site creation and text manipulation. He guides readers through the entire process of installing, configuring, using, and extending the Template Toolkit. Information in the book is based on Version 2.10 of the Template Toolkit, released in July 2003. No prior knowledge of Perl, the Template Toolkit, or HTML is required, although experience in HTML, web programming, XML, and SQL is useful for some chapters.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionAmong the many different approaches to templating with Perl--such as Embperl, Mason, HTML::Template, and hundreds of other lesser known systems--the Template Toolkit is widely recognized as one of the most versatile.  Like other templating systems, the Template Toolkit allows programmers to embed Perl code and custom macros into HTML documents in order to create customized documents on the fly. But unlike the others, the Template Toolkit is as facile at producing HTML as it is at producing XML, PDF, or any other output format. And because it has its own simple templating language, templates can be written and edited by people who don't know Perl. In short, the Template Toolkit combines the best features of its competitors, with ease-of-use and flexibility, resulting in a technology that's fast, powerful and extensible, and ideally suited to the production and maintenance of web content and other dynamic document systems.   In Perl Template Toolkit you'll find detailed coverage of this increasingly popular technology. Written by core members of the technology's development team, the book guides you through the entire process of installing, configuring, using, and extending the Template Toolkit. It begins with a fast-paced but thorough tutorial on building web content with the Template Toolkit, and then walks you through generating and using data files, particularly with XML. It also provides detailed information on the Template Toolkit's modules, libraries, and tools in addition to a complete reference manual.  Topics in the book include:Getting started with the template toolkitThe Template languageTemplate directivesFiltersPluginsExtending the Template ToolkitAccessing databasesXMLAdvanced static web page techniquesDynamic web content and web applicationsThe only book to cover this important tool, Perl Template Toolkit is essential reading for any Perl programmer who wants to create dynamic web content that is remarkably easy to maintain. This book is your surefire guide to implementing this fast, flexible, and powerful templating system.

review: If you've adopted Java as your organizational language, you're probably using, or planning to use, some sort of multitier design to maximize maintainability while making your data store accessible to as many applications as possible. The Jakarta engine ranks as the interface server of choice in that environment, and the Jakarta Struts Framework 1.1 makes it far easier to implement multitier information systems. <I>Programming Jakarta Struts</I> is the best how-to documentation around--in print or on the Internet--on the subject of using Struts to their greatest potential. Chuck Cavaness's book is comprehensive, detailed, critical of its subject where appropriate, and generally invaluable to anyone implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in Java with the assistance of Struts.<p>Thankfully, Cavaness opens with an overview of the MVC pattern with a focus on how you're meant to implement it under Struts. For anyone thinking that implementing MVC sounds like more trouble than it's worth, this clarifies why such design usually pays off in the long run. After that, it's into the particulars, which include code listings (lots of them, delightfully commented) and crystal-clear block diagrams that show the flow of messages among objects. There are also many database schema charts that show how the authors structure data in the storefront and shopping cart application that spans the whole of this volume. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> The Jakarta Struts Framework 1.1 and how to use it to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern. All the important features of Struts 1.1 get attention, including exception handling, the validation framework, internationalization, logging, and templating with the Tiles framework.

review: The PHP server-side scripting language and the MySQL database management system (DBMS) make a potent pair. Both are open-source products--free of charge for most purposes--remarkably strong, and capable of handling all but the most enormous transaction loads. Both are supported by large, skilled, and enthusiastic communities of architects, programmers, and designers. <I>PHP and MySQL Web Development</I> introduces readers (who are assumed to have little or no experience with the title subjects) to PHP and MySQL for the purpose of creating dynamic Internet sites. It teaches the same skills as introductory Active Server Pages (ASP) and ColdFusion books--technologies that address the same niche.<p>  Authors Luke Welling and Laura Thomson's technique aims to get readers going on their own projects as soon as possible. They present easily digestible sections on specific technical processes--"Accessing array contents" and "Using encryption with PHP" are two examples. Each section centers on a sample program that strips the task at hand down to its essentials, enabling the reader to fit the process into his or her own solutions as required. Tables that list options and other nuggets of reference material appear as well, but the many examples and the authors' commentary on them take center stage.<p>  For reference material on MySQL, have a look at Paul DuBois's <I>MySQL</I>. On the PHP side, <I>Web Application Development with PHP 4.0</I> is excellent. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>The MySQL database server (for both Unix and Windows) <li>Accessing MySQL databases through PHP scripting (the letters don't really stand for anything) <li>Database creation and modification <li>PHP tricks in order of increasing complexity--everything from basic SQL queries to secure transactions for commerce <li>Authentication <li>Network connectivity <li>Session management <li>Content customization</ul>

review: Earlier editions of O'Reilly's <I>Running Linux</I> served as central guides on installing, configuring, and using the OS. The third edition of this guide covers the kernel through version 2.2.1 and will prove especially useful to those with high technical aptitudes and a well-tested willingness to experiment with their computing environments. <p> The explanation of how to rebuild the kernel--a particularly daunting task for many--deserves special praise, as do the sections on configuring network links and servers. Users will find that the informative, prose-heavy style packs maximum information into this book's pages. For example, the purpose of a Linux element is described and then the reader is shown various ways of using it, complete with explicit statements of what you type and what you get in response.

review: Callaway describes communication protocols for wireless sensor networks and examines the architecture of systems need to implement them. Twelve chapters examine such topics as the design of a physical layer for long battery life and low-cost implementation; a discrete- event simulation tool with low duty cycle operation, a logical link control layer protocol, problems of power management for wireless sensor network nodes, the affect of antennas on network performance, and design techniques for electromagnetic compatibility.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionBecause they provide practical machine-to-machine communication at a very low cost, the popularity of wireless sensor networks is expected to skyrocket in the next few years, duplicating the recent explosion of wireless LANs. Wireless Sensor Networks: Architectures and Protocols describes how to build these networks, from the layers of the communication protocol through the design of network nodes. This overview summarizes the multiple applications of wireless sensor networks, then discusses network device design and the requirements that foster the successful performance of these applications.The book discusses factors affecting network design, including the partitioning of node functions into integrated circuits, low power system design, power sources, and the interaction between antenna selection and product design. It presents design techniques that improve electromagnetic compatibility and reduce damage from electrostatic discharge.The text also describes the design features of the wireless devices themselves, presenting a thorough analysis of the technology that engineers and students need to design and build the many future applications that will incorporate wireless sensor networks.

review: In this brand-new third edition of <I>The C++ Programming Language</I>, author Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, presents the full specification for the C++ language and standard library, a spec that will soon become the joint ISO/ANSI C++ standard.<p> Past readers will find that the new edition has changed a great deal and grown considerably to encompass new language features, particularly run-time type identification, namespaces, and the standard library. At the same time, readers will recognize the lucid style and sensible advice that made previous editions so readable and enjoyable. Probably the biggest change is a substantial new section, well over 200 pages in length, covering the contents and design of the C++ standard library, the most important new feature of the C++ specification. The author has also added a substantial number of new exercises while keeping many from previous editions that have retained their value.<p> While <I>The C++ Programming Language</I> is not a C++ tutorial, strictly speaking, anyone learning the language, especially those coming from C, will greatly benefit from the clear presentation of all its elements. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this book for anyone who is serious about using C++.

review: <I>Practical Unix & Internet Security</I> is on its second edition, and its maturity shows. To call this highly readable book comprehensive is an understatement. The breadth is vast, from fundamentals (definitions of computer security; the history of Unix) and commonsense but little-observed security basics (making backups; physical and personnel security; buggy software) to modern software (NFS, WWW, firewalls) and the handling of security incidents. The section on users and passwords alone is 21 pages long--and worth every page. Useful appendices include a Unix security checklist, a list of emergency response organizations, and many references to electronic and paper resources.<P> The Internet covers too much and moves too quickly for any book to cover every security aspect of every piece of software, but this book comes close. More importantly, it gives you an exceptional grounding in the fundamental issues of security and teaches the right questions to ask--something that will stay with you long after today's software is obsolete.

review: The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) A+ certification proves that you're a capable hardware technician--capable of upgrading, troubleshooting, and fixing problems related to physical devices (such as memory chips and video cards) in Intel-compatible personal computers. <I>A+ Certification for Dummies</I> is designed to help you review for the two A+ exams--Core Hardware (220-201) and Operating System Technologies (220-202)--and it succeeds at that goal. It's also worth reading if you're not interested in A+ certification, but want to know enough to change out your own hard drives and install expansion cards without the help of a technician.<p>  Ron Gilster teaches the subject--which encompasses good troubleshooting and repair practices as well as specific hardware facts--in a clear style that's easy to follow as you work on an actual machine (and, by the way, work on actual machines is essential to passing the tests). The book foregoes photographs (which almost never turn out well, and rarely look like your equipment anyway) in favor of clear line drawings. There are some step-by-step procedures to follow, but Gilster mostly recognizes that PC hardware varies a lot and leaves most specifics up to readers. One bit of advice: in the field, supplement this book with Scott Mueller's definitive hardware encyclopedia, <I>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</I>. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Intel-compatible personal computers, their essential subsystems (motherboard, RAM, processor, BIOS, video, disk storage, and others), and how to assemble, troubleshoot, and repair them.

review: <I>MySQL and mSQL</I> provides the essentials to programming with these two popular Unix freeware database packages in C/C++, Perl, Python, and Java. The book begins with a fine introduction to databases that covers tables, fields, indexes, and normalization. Then it explains the history of the freeware mSQL and MySQL packages (which offer better performance than commercial relational database management system (RDBMS) packages, though they don't support transactions or other features). Next the authors look at SQL as used within MySQL and mSQL and clarify where to download these packages and how to install them. Examples of how to program with MySQL/mSQL in C/C++ follow.<p> One of the best parts of this book is its introduction to using Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and Perl to power a Web site with a MySQL/mSQL database. This section offers complete information on using mSQL Perl (and the emerging Database Independent [DBI] standard) for developing CGI database scripts in Perl, and it includes clear examples (including a student database). The book then moves from Perl on to other programming languages--Python and Java. Reference material to all the relevant APIs is featured for each language.<p> Whatever programming API you choose, MySQL and mSQL are ready to meet the needs of the small to moderate-size Web site. This book delivers essential information on these packages and will help both Web masters and programmers get the most out of these powerful freeware database tools. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>

review: Microsoft has introduced the right server for a world now dominated by highly distributed systems and web-based server applications, and O'Reilly has written a book that will earn a prominent place on administrators' desk tops.  The GUI chapter is organized by topic according to major themes of Windows Server 2003 administration, providing one-stop shopping for busy admins. For example, if you want to find out about Active Directory and how to manage it, you'd begin by turning to Active Directory. Each topic begins with a description of basic concepts, followed by a description of tools (such as Microsoft Management Console snap-ins) used to administer the feature, instructions on how to perform common or important administrative tasks, and notes detailing subtle points and potential gotchas  Windows Server 2003 offers greatly enhanced command-line administration, and the command reference prominently highlights the many new commands in this release. Dozens of new commands and scripts have been added for administration of Active Directory, disks, event logs, Group Policy, IIS, network diagnostics, the pagefile, printers, processes, shared folders, and the Registry. The result is a Windows operating system platform that now rivals Unix in its ability to support command-line and scripted administration.

review: A poorly performing database application not only costs users time, but also has an impact on other applications running on the same computer or the same network. SQL Tuning provides an essential next step for SQL developers and database administrators who want to extend their SQL tuning expertise and get the most from their database applications.   There are two basic issues to focus on when tuning SQL: how to find and interpret the execution plan of an SQL statement and how to change SQL to get a specific alternate execution plan. SQL Tuning provides answers to these questions and addresses a third issue that's even more important: how to find the optimal execution plan for the query to use.   Author Dan Tow outlines a timesaving method he's developed for finding the optimum execution plan--rapidly and systematically--regardless of the complexity of the SQL or the database platform being used. You'll learn how to understand and control SQL execution plans and how to diagram SQL queries to deduce the best execution plan for a query. Key chapters in the book include exercises to reinforce the concepts you've learned. SQL Tuning concludes by addressing special concerns and unique solutions to unsolvable problems.   Whether you are a programmer who develops SQL-based applications or a database administrator or other who troubleshoots poorly tuned applications, SQL Tuning will arm you with a reliable and deterministic method for tuning your SQL queries to gain optimal performance.

review: For UNIX system administrators, provides a sendmail tutorial, plus reference material on every aspect of the program. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.Book DescriptionThis second edition of sendmail covers sendmail Version 8.8 from Berkeley and the standard versions available on most systems. It is far  and away the most comprehensive book ever written on sendmail, the program  that acts like a traffic cop in routing and delivering mail on Unix-based  networks. Although sendmail is used on almost every Unix system, it's one  of the last great uncharted territories--and most difficult utilities to  learn--in Unix system administration.  This book provides a complete sendmail tutorial, plus extensive reference  material on every aspect of the program. Part One is a tutorial on  understanding sendmail; Part Two covers the building, installation, and  m4 configuration of sendmail; Part Three covers practical issues in sendmail  administration; Part Four is a comprehensive reference section; and Part  Five consists of appendixes and a bibliography.  In this second edition an expanded tutorial demonstrates hub's cf file and nullclient.mc. Other topics include the #error delivery agent, sendmail's exit values, MIME headers, and how to set up and use the user database, mailertable, and smrsh. Solution-oriented examples  throughout the book help you solve your own sendmail problems. Plus, this  edition is cross-referenced with section numbers.

review: Bioinformatics--the application of computational and analytical methods to  biological problems--is a rapidly evolving scientific discipline. Genome  sequencing projects are producing vast amounts of biological data for many  different organisms, and, increasingly, storing these data in public  databases. Such biological databases are growing exponentially, along with  the biological literature. It's impossible for even the most zealous researcher  to stay on top of necessary information in the field without the aid of  computer-based tools. Bioinformatics is all about building these tools.    <i>Developing Bioinformatics Computer Skills</i> is for scientists and  students who are learning computational approaches to biology for the first  time, as well as for experienced biology researchers who are just starting to  use computers to handle their data. The book covers the Unix file system,  building tools and databases for bioinformatics, computational approaches to  biological problems, an introduction to Perl for bioinformatics, data  mining, and data visualization.    Written in a clear, engaging style, <i>Developing Bioinformatics Computer  Skills</i> will help biologists develop a structured approach to biological  data as well as the tools they'll need to analyze the data.

review: Completely revised and improved, the second edition of <I>Programming Python</I> is an excellent compendium of material geared toward the more knowledgeable Python developer. It includes dozens of reusable scripts for common scripting tasks, and is one of the best available sources of information for this popular object-oriented scripting language.<p>  In over 1,200 pages of material, this book offers an extremely comprehensive guide to Python development. Though his book is densely packed with information, Mark Lutz is a lively and witty writer whose focus is on getting things done using the natural strengths of the Python language. To that end, after an introduction and history of the language, the book shows how to use Python for performing automated tasks with files and directories (for example, for doing backups both locally and on Web servers). Not only will this book teach you more about Python, but it will also give you a library of code that you can use as is or adapt for your own projects.<p>  The text covers every conceivable facet of Python and the language's support for networking, files and directories, task management, and even persistence (through its support for <I>shelves</I>). Complete Python programs show how to create e-mail clients, do reporting, and create Web applications (for an online errata database). Chapters on doing graphics programming in Python, as well as coverage of both built-in and custom data structures, are especially good. Because Python is often used for automating installations (in some Linux distributions, for instance), readers will appreciate the sample code and tips for using Python to create bulletproof installs.<p>  Later sections show how get Python to work with C, Java (through <I>JPython</I>), and other languages. The book concludes with useful reference sections summarizing key aspects of Python, like its revision history, relationship to C++, and other material. There aren't many titles on Python, and fans of this up-and-coming language are lucky to have such a solid tutorial and guide available in <I>Programming Python</I>. Perfect for those with just a little previous exposure to the language, it's all you need to master Python in-depth and tap its considerable power for virtually any software project. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to Python <li>Basic system scripts with Python (including file and directory tools) <li>Working with processes and threads <li>Pipes and signals <li>Sample scripts for system and Web utilities (including backing up files, program launching, replicating and managing directories) <li>Graphical user interface design in Python (including the <I>Tkinter</I> module) <li>Widgets and basic components <li>Layout options <li>Event handling <li>GUI examples (including a working text editor, image viewer, and clock) <li>Network scripting (sockets, FTP, and e-mail clients) <li>Server-side scripting <li>Sample server scripts for an online errata database <li>Python on the Internet (including Zope, JPython, and XML tools) <li>Databases and persistence in Python (including <I>pickled</I> objects and <I>shelf</I> files) <li>Custom and built-in data structures in Python <li>Text and string handling <li>C integration with Python (including the SWIG module) <li>Embedding Python calls within C <li>Hints for using Python in real projects <li>Reference to recent changes to Python <li>Python vs. C++ quick-start guide</ul>

review: Although Learning XML covers XML rather broadly, it nevertheless presents the key elements of the technology with enough detail to familiarize the reader with this crucial markup language. This guide is brief enough to tackle in a weekend.  Author Erik T. Ray begins with an excellent summary of XML's history as an outgrowth of SGML and HTML. He outlines very clearly the elements of markup, demystifying concepts such as attributes, entities, and namespaces with numerous clear examples. To illustrate a real-world XML application, he gives the reader a look at a document written in DocBook--a publicly available XML document type for publishing technical writings--and explains the sections of the document step by step. A more simplified version of DocBook is used later in the book to illustrate transformation--a powerful benefit of XML.  The all-important Document Type Definition (DTD) is covered in depth, but the still-unofficial alternative, XML Schema, is only briefly addressed. The author makes liberal use of graphics, tables, and code to demonstrate concepts along the way, keeping the reader engaged and on track. Ray also goes deep into some discussion of programming XML utilities with Perl.  Learning XML is a very readable introduction to XML for readers with existing knowledge of markup and Web technologies. It meets its goals very well--to deliver a broad perspective of XML and its potential. --Stephen W. Plain  Topics covered:XML overview XPointer XLink XHTML Presentation with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Document Type Definitions (DTDs) XML Schemas Transformation with XSLT Internationalization Simple API for XML (SAX) --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.Book DescriptionThis new edition of the bestselling Learning XML provides web developers with a concise but grounded understanding of XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and its potential--not just a whirlwind tour of XML.    Learning XML illustrates the core XML concepts and language syntax, in addition to important related tools such as the CSS and XSL styling languages and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures. It includes information about three schema languages for validation: W3C Schema, Schematron, and RELAX-NG, which are gaining widespread support from people who need to validate documents but aren't satisfied with DTDs. Also new in this edition is a chapter on XSL-FO, a powerful formatting language for XML.

review: Intended for experienced Access database developers familiar with Visual Basic for Applications, the 170 tips provided in this book suggest advanced approaches to user interface and programming tasks, such as queries, reports, optimization, multi-user applications, Windows APIs, and automation. The second edition adds four chapters on SharePoint, smart tags, Microsoft .NET, and XML. The CD-ROM contains Access databases.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionNot a reference book, and not a tutorial either, the new second edition of the highly regarded Access Cookbook is an uncommonly useful collection of solutions to problems that Access users and developers are likely to face as they attempt to build increasingly complex applications.    Although using any single recipe in the book will more than pay back the cost of the book in terms of both hours saved and frustration thwarted, Access Cookbook, Second Edition is much more than a handy assortment of cut-and-paste code.    Each of the recipes examine a particular problem--problems that commonly occur when you push the upper limits of Access, or ones that are likely to trip up a developer attempting to design a more elegant Access application--even some things you never knew Access could do.  The authors then, in a clear, accessible, step-by-step style, present the problems' solution. Following each recipe are insights on how Access works, potential pitfalls, interesting programming techniques that are used in the solution, and how and why the solution works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to other similar situations.   Fully updated for Access 2003, Access Cookbook, Second Edition is also one of the first books to thoroughly explore new support for .NET managed code and XML. All of the practical, real-world examples have been tested for compatibility with Access 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. This updated new edition also covers Access and SharePoint, Access and SmartTags, Access and .NET; and Access and XML.   Access power users and programmers at all levels, from the relatively inexperienced to the most sophisticated, will rely on the Access Cookbook for quick solutions to gnarly problems. With a dog-eared copy of Access Cookbook at your side, you can spend your time and energy where it matters most: working on the interesting facets of your Access application, not just the time-consuming ones.

review: Written for the more experienced C/C++ developer moving to Palm development, <I>Palm OS Programming, Second Edition</I> sets an admirable standard as a programming tutorial that will let anyone get onboard with the best techniques and APIs used to build state-of-the-art Palm applications.<p>  Few programming titles are as well written as this one. The authors consistently engage the reader with a tone that's smart and surprisingly personable given that this is a technical book. They first examine what is special about the Palm platform, including the best way to build user interfaces, plus dos and don'ts for new software. Early sections dissect real software (DateBk4 from Pimlico Software) with commentary from one of its inventors. After surveying the wide array of Palm development options (including CodeWarrior and the Palm OS Emulator, POSE), it's on to a simple Palm program.<p>  While many programming texts use samples that grow in complexity, this title is anchored by a single case study--a sales application. As the authors cover the basics of Palm development, from event handling basics, APIs for memory management, and form control programming, they provide the APIs you'll need to know. Then they show how their case study makes use of these features. (This approach is effective, though it assumes a bit of programming knowledge on the part of the reader.) <p>  Standout sections here inspect what makes Palm development special, including memory management techniques, plus there's a fascinating look at automated testing tools (called Gremlins), which can find bugs by executing thousands of simulated user actions. Later sections delve into what it takes to create HotSync capabilities for your Palm applications. These modules, called Conduits, clearly present a programming challenge, and the coverage here will benefit developers of all levels of experience on the Palm platform.<p>  The Palm platform has been a real success story, and <I>Palm OS Programming: The Developer's Guide</I> reveals why. It shows you how to think like a real Palm developer and gives you the specific APIs and programming techniques you need to know in order to write professional-quality Palm applications in C/C++. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>

review: It's about time: <I>Mac OS X for Unix Geeks</I> arrives on the scene none too soon for UNIX aficionados who, having heard that the latest editions of Mac OS are based on a UNIX variant, want to see how the platform compares to more venerable versions of the eminently configurable operating system. This book highlights some key differences between the Darwin environment and more conventional UNIXs, enabling people with UNIX experience to take advantage of it as they learn the Mac OS X way of doing things at the command line.<p>This skinny volume neither aims to teach its readers UNIX nor introduce them to the Mac, but rather to show how Apple has implemented UNIX. It's a fast read that assumes--as the title implies--rather a lot of UNIX knowledge. With that requirement satisfied and this book in hand, you're likely to discover aspects of Aqua more quickly than you otherwise would have.<p>The authors spend lots of time explaining how administrative tasks--such as managing groups, users, and passwords--are handled in the Mac OS environment. They document <I>netinfo</I> fully, and call attention to its limitations (like its inability to create home directories for users) by explaining how to do the job on the command line. They also cover C programming in the Darwin universe at greater length than any other book does, providing explicit instructions for such important tasks as creating header files and linking static libraries. A guide to the command line (they call the reference section--groan--"The Missing Manpages") provides good value at this book's conclusion. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to get around in Darwin, the UNIX implementation  built into Mac OS X. Sections deal with basic maneuvering at the command line, LDAP services, C programming, and graphical user interfaces under Aqua. There's a short section on building the kernel itself, but it's limited in scope.

review: If you use MySQL, you know why it's the world's most popular open source database: small, fast, and powerful, and so rich in features that no administrator or programmer can stay familiar with all of them.  There are always some little-known commands and clauses that could help you become more efficient in your work if you could just keep them in mind. The problem is, you don't always have time to stop and thumb through an exhaustive reference when you're hard at work. If you need a quick reminder, the MySQL Pocket Referenc can lead you straight to the answer you need to know to get the job done.   Easy to take and use anywhere, this little book provides instant reminders on how to use important MySQL functions in conjunction with key parts of the LAMP open source infrastructure. A complete reference to the MySQL version of SQL, this pocket guide also serves as a convenient companion to our large, in-depth volume, Managing and Using MySQL. The book covers installation of MySQL and includes a description of SQL commands, data types, operators, and functions. In this small book, you get a handy reference to the enormous feature set of MySQL, the dominant database in the open source world.

review: Many serious Java programmers, especially enterprise Java programmers, consider the new I/O API--called NIO for New Input/Output--the most important feature in the 1.4 version of the Java 2 Standard Edition. The NIO package includes many things that have been missing from previous editions of Java that are critical to writing high-performance, large-scale applications: improvements in the areas of buffer management, scalable network and file I/O, character-set support, and regular expression matching.  Most of all, it boosts performance and speed dramatically.    Java NIO explores the new I/O capabilities of version 1.4 in detail and shows you how to put these features to work to greatly improve the efficiency of the Java code you write.  This compact volume examines the typical challenges that Java programmers face with I/O and shows you how to take advantage of the capabilities of the new I/O features.  You'll learn how to put these tools to work using examples of common, real-world I/O problems and see how the new features have a direct impact on responsiveness, scalability, and reliability.    Because the NIO APIs supplement the I/O features of version 1.3, rather than replace them, you'll also learn when to use new APIs and when the older 1.3 I/O APIs are better suited to your particular application.  Java NIO is for any Java programmer who is interested in learning how to boost I/O performance, but if you're developing applications where performance is critical, such as game computing or large-scale enterprise applications, you'll want to give this book a permanent spot on your bookshelf.  With the NIO APIs, Java no longer takes a backseat to any language when it comes to performance.  Java NIO will help you realize the benefits of these exciting new features.

review: Since the dawn of computing, software designers and developers have searched for ways to describe the systems they worked so hard to create. Flowcharts enabled the concise documentation of program-flow and algorithms. Entity-relationship diagrams enabled database designers to convey the structure underlying the collection of tables and columns that made up a schema. From the beginning, technologists recognized the descriptive power inherent in visual representations of a system, yet it wasn't until 1997 that the first attempt to create a visual language that could be used across all aspects of a system development project came to fruition. Unified Modeling Language (UML) was born.  UML has taken the software development industry by storm. Widely supported by development and documentation tools, UML can be used on the one hand by programmers to record such things as the detailed design of classes in an object-oriented system and on the other hand by business analysts to give the broad-brush picture of how a system interacts with users and other systems. UML has become the lingua franca of software development, and no one in the software industry can afford to be without knowledge of this powerfully expressive visual language.  Learning UML introduces UML and places it in perspective, then leads you through an orderly progress towards mastery of the language. You'll begin by learning how UML is used to model the structure of a system. Many key UML concepts, especially that of the general (classes) versus the specific (objects), are illustrated in the chapter on class and object diagrams.  Next, you'll learn how to use use-case diagrams to model the functionality of a system. Finally, you'll see how component and deployment diagrams are used to model the way in which a system is deployed in a physical environment.  Structural modeling answers the who and what questions of systems development. Behavioral modeling addresses the questions of when, how, and why. You'll learn how to use sequence and collaboration, to model the interaction over time between system components, how to use state diagrams to describe the life cycle of system components, and how to use activity diagrams to document control-flow and responsibility.   Throughout this book, author Sinan Si Alhir maintains a clear focus on UML the language and avoids getting caught up in the cobwebs of methodology. His presentation is direct and to-the-point.  Each chapter ends with a set of exercises that you can use to test your growing knowledge of UML and its concepts. As you work your way through the book, you'll find yourself warming up to the simple yet expressive language that is UML, and using it to communicate effectively and professionally about all aspects of system design.

review: The uninitiated may think this book describes a computer program named Power Hound, but in fact the topic is Mac OS X (Panther) and how to master its complexity (and attain hound-hood). Early sections deal with system configuration and basic program utilities. Then the secrets of ITunes, IPhoto,  IApps (e.g. iCal, iChar, etc.), and many other Apple utilities are revealed. Interestingly, the last two chapters make clear that Mac OS X is an important derivative of the UNIX system by detailing the many powerful command line sequences available and suggesting methods by which users working at this level can master the machine. The presentation is well organized and includes many useful screen images, a very detailed table of contents, and a serviceable index.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionMac OS X has captured the attention of consumers and programmers alike with its ability to run existing Mac programs along with Unix and Open Source software. The latest version, Panther, includes more than a hundred new features and improves many of the technologies underlying Mac OS X, including graphics and the Unix-based core. With more than 500 power tips and tricks for Mac aficionados like yourself, Mac OS X Power Hound, Panther Edition helps you unleash the power of Panther.  Mac OS X Panther is a complex and powerful operating system with a personality all its own.

review: Without Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), network  administrators might have to actually get out of their chairs and go  see what's up with all of the network-connected equipment under their  authority. Perish the thought. <I>Essential SNMP</I> explains how the  management protocol works and how it's implemented by several operating  systems and pieces of equipment. More importantly, this book shows its  reader--who should be a network administrator who's familiar with the  problems of running a distributed network--how SNMP can earn its place  as a network administration tool. In other words, this book examines  SNMP as a strategic resource as well as a technical  phenomenon.<p>Because it's oriented toward SNMP as a tool, much of the  coverage in this book has to do with software that uses SNMP to provide  network monitoring and control services. After a  strengths-and-weaknesses overview of a number of SNMP packages, the  authors use mainly HP OpenView, Castle Rock SNMPc, and Net-SNMP (the  last in combination with Perl scripting) to demonstrate how SNMP works  and how to take advantage of it. It's the scripting that really  distinguishes this book from other SNMP books, by the way. It's  integral to the authors' presentation, and the latter half of this book  is packed with shell and Perl listings. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and  its applicability as a network management tool. Details like object  identifiers (OIDs), management information bases (MIBs), traps, and  community strings are defined and explained. The configuration of SNMP  agents is detailed for several software packages and operating systems,  and the integration of SNMP and scripts (in shell languages and in  Perl) is covered nicely.

review: Those halcyon days of slamming competitors, terrorists, and overgrown kids with suburban angst against a simple firewall are over. According to Cox and Gerg, professionals in the field, demands of the market have made security a more complex matter of learning how to organize records, segregate data, and use an intruder detection system. They describe how to install, configure, administer, and troubleshoot the Snort Intruder Detection System, and how to turn it into an intruder prevention system. They also describe how to use the management consoles, the Oinkmaster (to automatically update rules), and include tools like Barnyard and Squil, which you can employ to keep malefactors' nasty little mitts off your servers. They include online references.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIntrusion detection is not for the faint at heart. But, if you are a network administrator chances are you're under increasing pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are safe--in fact impenetrable--from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders.   Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is a vital but daunting challenge. Because of this, a plethora of complex, sophisticated, and pricy software solutions are now available. In terms of raw power and features, SNORT, the most commonly used Open Source Intrusion Detection System, (IDS) has begun to eclipse many expensive proprietary IDSes. In terms of documentation or ease of use, however, SNORT can seem overwhelming. Which output plugin to use?  How do you to email alerts to yourself? Most importantly, how do you sort through the immense amount of information Snort makes available to you?   Many intrusion detection books are long on theory but short on specifics and practical examples. Not Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools.  This new book is a thorough, exceptionally practical guide to managing network security using Snort 2.1 (the latest release) and dozens of other high-quality open source other open source intrusion detection programs.   Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools covers reliable methods for detecting network intruders, from using simple packet sniffers to more sophisticated IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) applications and the GUI interfaces for managing them. A comprehensive but concise guide for monitoring illegal entry attempts, this invaluable new book explains how to shut down and secure workstations, servers, firewalls, routers, sensors and other network devices.   Step-by-step instructions are provided to quickly get up and running with Snort. Each chapter includes links for the programs discussed, and additional links at the end of the book give administrators access to numerous web sites for additional information and instructional material that will satisfy even the most serious security enthusiasts.  Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools maps out a proactive--and effective--approach to keeping your systems safe from attack.

review: This title brings the popular three-week tutorial format to aspiring Delphi 4 programmers, combining plenty of hands-on knowledge of the most essential features of Delphi 4, including its strong database capabilities. This book is a good choice for the beginner or intermediate programmer who wants to get a solid foundation in Delphi 4 development in a minimal amount of time. <p> The book begins with the basics of the Delphi programming environment and object-oriented Pascal. The author then explains the fundamentals of developing with the Visual Component Library (VCL) and discusses how to build basic user interfaces and menus using Delphi 4 design tools. This first section also includes excellent material on graphics and multimedia programming.<p> Further chapters examine the basics of building database programs, again using Delphi wizards. More advanced topics include building and using dynamic link-libraries (DLLs) and ActiveX components, plus creating Web-browser applications with Delphi's support for Internet controls.<p> Though this tutorial stresses the basics, there's quite a bit of material here on the finer points of programming using the built-in abilities of Delphi. There's also good attention to using the wizards and tools that help make Delphi a much more productive environment. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>

review: Web designers loved <I>Eric Meyer on CSS</I>, which proved that a book could be both technically competent (it explained Cascading Style Sheets clearly) and aesthetically astute (printed in color, the book showed off Meyer's work brilliantly). <I>More Eric Meyer on CSS</I> picks up where the original book ended, going into detail on a score of important Web-design tasks. As he did with his first book, Meyer has had this one laid out in a broad-page format, with many illustrations, and printed in full color. The net effect is that readers see the design effects of the CSS tweaks under discussion, and there's no way to imagine (or load code) to see how colors and shadings look when rendered in a browser.<p>  Appealingly, this book is oriented around typical design projects (such as annual financial reports, weblogs, and personal homepages) and widely used design features (including menus and index tabs). This structure ensures the utility of Meyer's book--you can just turn to the chapter that deals with whatever you're trying to build, and see what the author did in a similar situation. Each section involves far more prose than code; Meyer is very careful to spend more time explaining what he's doing than he spends actually doing it, and the reader is never overwhelmed by giant CSS listings. Numerous screen shots intersperse the code and commentary, allowing you to see the intermediate results of style sheets in progress and adapt Meyer's beginnings in order to achieve different ends. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to design professional-looking documents for online publication. Aspects of CSS that affect position, color, typeface, and other design elements are covered, as are the special considerations that relate to navigation tabs and images. A number of case studies (including a look at the author's contribution to the Zen Garden design project) make ideas clear.

review: Featuring 230 recipes, this guide offers practical code solutions to web application problems commonly facing developers.  It offers ready-to-use code and advice on working with JSTL, authenticating clients, interacting with database and email servers, reading and setting cookies, uploading files, embedding multimedia files, and similar tasks.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionWith literally hundreds of examples and thousands of lines of code, the Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook yields tips and techniques that any Java web developer who uses JavaServer Pages or servlets will use every day, along with full-fledged solutions to significant web application development problems that developers can insert directly into their own applications.   Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook presents real-world problems, and provides concise, practical solutions to each. Finding even one tested code recipe that solves a gnarly problem in this comprehensive collection of solutions and best practices will save hours of frustration--easily justifying the cost of this invaluable book.   But Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook is more than just a wealth of cut-and-paste code. It also offers clear explanations of how and why the code works, warns of potential pitfalls, and directs you to sources of additional information, so you can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.   These recipes include vital topics like the use of Ant to setup a build environment, extensive coverage of the WAR file format and web.xml deployment descriptor, file-uploading, error-handling, cookies, logging, dealing with non-HTML content, multimedia, request filtering, web services, I18N, web services, and a host of other topics that frustrate even the most seasoned developers.   For Java web developers of all levels who are eager to put into practice the theory presented in other API-focused books, the solutions presented in this practical book will prove invaluable over and over again. This is painless way for less experienced developers who prefer to learn by doing to expand their skills and productivity, while accomplishing practical solutions to the pressing problems they face every day. More experienced developers can use these recipes to solve time-consuming problems quickly, freeing up their time for the more creative aspects of their work.

review: The Domain Naming System (DNS) is a glorious thing. It takes familiar Internet network and machine names (like "amazon.com") and converts them to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like "208.35.218.15") that are meaningful to routers and therefore useful for identifying the machine you want to reach. What's amazing is that DNS enables someone in Germany to refer, by name, to a computer in Mongolia even if no one in Germany has ever accessed the distant machine before. It's pretty much self-configuring, too: No human effort in Germany is necessary to make the Mongolian machine reachable by name. <I>DNS and BIND</I> explains how DNS works better for this than any other piece of documentation, printed or otherwise. The work of Paul Albitz and Cricket Liu, now in its fourth revision, has long been considered a classic among systems administrators and network architects, particularly those with a Unix bent.<p>  The fourth edition is mainly an update: The authors have added coverage of incremental and conditional zone transfer with BIND's new NOTIFY features, as well as of Transaction Signatures (TSIG), and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). Sections on firewalling and DNS for IPv6 addresses have been expanded. Throughout, Albitz and Liu maintain their impeccable style, combining text and illustrative listings into an educational whole. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> The Domain Naming System (DNS) and how it's implemented by BIND (through versions 8.2.3 and 9.1.0), how to set up BIND, how to configure MX records for mail service, parent and child domains, NOTIFY, and DNS security.

review: A soup-to-nuts overview of just what it takes to successfully design, develop and manage an online game. Learn from the top two online game developers through the real-world successes and mistakes not known to others. There are Case studies from 10+ industry leaders, including Raph Koster, J. Baron, R. Bartle, D. Schubert, A. Macris, and more! Covers all types of online games: Retail Hybrids, Persistent Worlds, and console games. Developing Online Games provides insight into designing, developing and managing online games that is available nowhere else. Online game programming guru Jessica Mulligan and seasoned exec Bridgette Patrovsky provide insights into the industry that will allow others entering this market to avoid the mistakes of the past. In addition to their own experiences, the authors provide interviews, insight and anecdotes from over twenty of the most well-known and experienced online game insiders. The book includes case studies of the successes and failures of today's most well-known online games. There is also a special section for senior executives on how to budget an online game and how to assemble the right development and management teams. The book ends with a look at the future of online gaming: not only online console gaming (Xbox Online, Playstation 2), but the emerging mobile device game market (cell phones, wireless, PDA). From the AuthorIf more than 30 years of knowledge and experience were available, would you spend 0-5 million developing an online game without knowing what worked in the past and, equally as important, what had not worked? Most would answer Of course not! Yet that is exactly what publishers and developers have done repeatedly. The results were predictable.  This book was written to spread the word on what works and what doesn't. We hope to save you money and, more importantly, keep you from crashing and burning your company with tired old mistakes. (Feel free to make new ones. That's how we learn!)  This is an accumulation of our experience in all phases of the design, development, and management of online games, combined with the views and experiences of other experts with experience in the field. These experiences and views can help guide you to successful... and profitable... online games.  Jessica Mulligan and Bridgette Patrovsky

review: XML is an elegant and straightforward way to define data-centric documents to feed almost any kind of data processing or rendering system. The linchpin of many XML solutions, however, is XSLT. This standard provides a way to transform your XML documents into other XML formats, HTML, and almost any other format you wish. <I>XSLT</I> is an excellent tutorial on this critical technology, a must-have text for developers getting serious with XML.<p>  This book is targeted at busy developers who want to learn standards-compliant skills with XSLT and learn them fast. The author uses the Apache Xalan XSLT engine for demonstration, but the material in the book is equally applicable to the XSLT engine in Microsoft's MSMXL parser, Saxon, and many other equivalent XSLT processors. <p>  The material is presented logically from the transformation of a simple "Hello World!" XML file to an HTML document onto XPath locations, branching, linking, combining XML documents, and extension functions. After laying the groundwork for what XSLT can do, the author presents a fairly sophisticated case study--an online tutorial generator that generates HTML files, PDF files, and Zip files. <p>  Aside from being a subject tutorial, <I>XSLT</I> is also an excellent reference that comes in handy for daily coding. The appendices cover XSLT, XPath, a function reference, and a frequently asked questions section. These reference sections include complete examples that make each concept quite clear. XSLT provides the horsepower behind XML, and this book provides the perfect vehicle to master transformation techniques. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Basic style sheet structure, XPath data model, branching and control elements, links and cross-references, sorting and grouping, combining XML documents, XSLT extension functions, case study, XSLT reference, XPath reference, function reference, XSLT guide (FAQ)., <i>XSLT</i> documents a core technology for processing XML. Originally created for page layout, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Transformations) is now much more: a general-purpose translation tool, a system for reorganizing document content, and a way to generate multiple results-- such as HTML, WAP, and SVG--from the same content.    What sets <i>XSLT</i> apart from other books on this critical tool is the depth of detail and breadth of knowledge that Doug Tidwell, a developer with years of XSLT experience, brings to his concise treatment of the many talents of XSLT. He covers XSLT and XPath, a critical companion standard, and addresses topics ranging from basic transformations to complex sorting and linking. He explores extension functions on a variety of different XSLT processors and shows ways to combine multiple documents using XSLT. Code examples add a real-world dimension to each technique.    Useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it difficult to get started in, and the ability to use advanced techniques depends on a clear and exact understanding of how XSLT templates work and interact. For instance, the understanding of "variables" in XSLT is deeply different from the understanding of "variables" in procedural languages. The author explains XSLT by building from the basics to its more complex and powerful possibilities, so that whether you're just starting out in XSLT or looking for advanced techniques, you'll find the level of information you need.

review: <P>The platform-centric SoC method is aimed at the design of today&#8217;s SoC systems with emphasis on real-time, embedded systems. The approach provides a guideline and an SoC design environment that promotes an integration of state-of-the-art tools and techniques necessary for the development of the systems. It renders a new and better perspective towards co-design approaches, while also raising a level of design abstraction. Because the configurable platform objects are designed off-cycle, they contribute to a general improvement in development time. By incorporating their usage, the overall method strikes a balance between total design flexibility and minimal time-to-market.</P> <P>In Chapter 1, challenges in the co-design of SoCs are introduced. The chapter briefly describes the technical challenges facing system developers and introduces a proposed solution to the problem. The remainder of this book presents a more thorough examination on the problem and the proposed approach.</P> <P>Chapter 2 describes the proposed platform-centric SoC design method in detail. It illustrates the design flow and discusses each main step in the design process. Definition of a platform as originally defined by Sabbagh [96], as well as the platform-based and platform-centric design approaches, are presented. The chapter concludes by comparing the proposed approach with previous related work.</P> <P>Chapter 3 lays out the technological background for the proposed SoC design method. Whereas the platform technology is discussed in Chapter 2, this chapter gives an overview of the other two fundamental technologies: the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The chapter begins with an introduction to UML as a modeling tool very well perceived within the software engineering community. It is followed by a discussion on an attempt by the Object Management Group (OMG) to empower UML for the development of real-time embedded software &#8211; an effort which will eventually culminate in a design framework known as the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance, and Time Specification [29]. Thereafter, an overview of XML and a few other related internet technologies ensue.</P> <P>Chapter 4 outlines the structure of the library of platform objects (LPO), as well as furnishes a comprehensive guideline and requirements specification that a platform object must possess in order to be scalable and compatible with the proposed approach. Essential elements for each platform object, e.g. architecture blueprint, XML-based self-described modules, platform managing tool, etc., are also discussed in detail. </P> <P>Chapter 5 provides a detailed treatment of UML extensions for the development of real-time embedded systems. The chapter starts with a layout of the Co-design Modeling Framework (CMF) hierarchy that encompasses five other sub-profiles &#8211; the generic utility profile (PCUprofile), the Exception Modeling profile (EMprofile), the Interrupt Modeling profile (IMprofile), the Synthesizable Hardware Description Language profile (SHDLprofile), and the Architecture Blueprint profile (ABprofile). Each of these profiles furnishes a design framework that is specifically tailored for the proposed approach, and may be able to meet with the challenges posed by the design and test of real-time embedded SoC-based systems. The chapter, then, proceeds to discuss the domain concept for each sub-profile, followed by the description of the corresponding stereotypes. </P> <P>Chapter 6 applies the platform-centric SoC design method, using the CMF profile in UML, to the development of a simplified digital camera system so as to demonstrate the use and the robustness of the proposed approach. Specifically, the NiOS development board is used to mimic the digital camera system where raw image data are read from a charge-coupled device (CCD), and then JPEG encoded and stored into memory. The chapter begins with an overview of the Altera&#8217;s NiOS system, followed by the actual system development process that explicitly demonstrates the use of the proposed approach. A quantitative evaluation is then presented that compares the development cost of the proposed platform-centric SoC design method against some alternative approaches using cost estimation models and tools.</P> <P>Chapter 7 concludes the book with a summary and a discussion of future directions for this effort on platform-based design. </P>

review: This title provides an insight into the rich diversity of techniques, tools and knowledge used in performance engineering, covering the whole life cycle - from design through to operation - of both networks and systems.  Performance modelling is discussed as an essential technique, providing the ability to predict performance through a quantitative understanding of how varying demand affects the behaviour of a system or network. Performance testing is discussed as offering the final opportunity to address the concerns of economic pressures pushing the identification and resolution of performances further down the supplier chain. The rapid introduction of widespread Internet access through IP-dial, the performance of live networks and systems and the performance implications of delivering broadband services are also examined.

review: Approaching the technology as a development tool, not just a platform, this guide offers instructions for developing Java code, working with JAR files, setting configurations, selecting runtimes, creating Javadoc, testing and debugging, using The Standard Widget Toolkit, web development, and the like. Practical skills are emphasized in examples throughout.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionJava programmers know how finicky Java can be to work with. An omitted semi-colon or the slightest typo will cause the Java command-line compiler to spew pages of annoying error messages across your screen. And it doesn't fix them--that's up to you: fix them, compile again, and hope that nothing goes wrong this time.   Eclipse, the popular Java integrated development environment (IDE) provides an elegant and powerful remedy for this common, frustrating scenario. It doesn't just catch your errors before you compile, it also suggests solutions. All you need to do is point and click. And it's free--what could be better? Still, if you're like most programmers, mastering a new technology--no matter how productive it will make you in the long run--is going to take a chunk out of your productivity now. You want to get up to speed quickly without sacrificing efficiency.   O'Reilly's new guide to the technology, Eclipse, provides exactly what you're looking for: a fast-track approach to mastery of Eclipse. This insightful, hands-on book delivers clear and concise coverage, with no fluff, that gets down to business immediately. The book is tightly focused, covering all aspects of Eclipse: the menus, preferences, views, perspectives, editors, team and debugging techniques, and how they're used every day by thousands of developers. Development of practical skills is emphasized with dozens of examples presented throughout the book.   From cover-to-cover, the book is pure Eclipse, covering hundreds of techniques beginning with the most basic Java development through creating your own plug-in editors for the Eclipse environment. Some of the topics you'll learn about include:   Using Eclipse to develop Java code   Testing and debugging   Working in teams using CVS   Building Eclipse projects using Ant   The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)   Web development   Developing Struts applications with Eclipse  From basics to advanced topics, Eclipse takes you through the fundamentals of Eclipse and more. You may be an Eclipse novice when you pick up the book, but you'll be a pro by the time you've finished.

review: C++ in a Nutshell packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills.    The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers.  When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax, or parameters required by library routines quickly. C++ in a Nutshell is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.

review: At its core, Amazon.com is a great big database concerned with lots of <I>stuff</I>--books, of course, but also tools, clothing, films on DVD, kitchen equipment, and lots and lots (and lots) of Harry Potter paraphernalia. Want to wear an Anna Kournikova exercise brassiere while juicing celery (presumably with considerable vigor)? Amazon can help. Need a cricket bat, radar gun, dietary fiber supplement, or vibrasonic molechaser? Amazon has what you need. Which is all great, but the real value of Amazon.com isn't that these things are in the database. The real value of this site lies in the information about all that stuff--reviews, sales rankings, recommendations, and the like--and the large number of ways to access it. <I>Amazon Hacks</I> explains how to get the most out of Amazon.com as an ordinary customer with a Web browser and as a software developer interested in the site's considerable collection of Web Services.<p>  In <I>Amazon Hacks</I>, Paul Bausch documents most of the avenues Amazon.com has opened up for exploration of the database. A lot of his coverage borders on the obvious: Sections on how to "Power-Search for Books" and "Put an Item Up for Bid at Amazon Auctions" aren't too different from Amazon's own explanatory articles. Coverage of how to add an Amazon search box to your own site, and add Amazon Associates item links to various kinds of Weblogs (including Blosxom and Moveable Type) are much handier. Bausch really shines when explaining Amazon.com's Web Services (AWS), the remotely accessible software interfaces that enables programs to search the database. He includes AWS-enabled programs in PHP, Python, and Perl. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered</B>: How to use Amazon.com as a Web surfer, Web site publisher, and software developer. Detailed coverage goes to advanced product search techniques, managing the characteristics associated with your Amazon login, selling through Amazon Auctions and zShops, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) API for Perl, PHP, and Python.

review: Scott Oakes' <I>Java Security</I> is extraordinary both for its technical depth and its readability. It provides the Java programmer with a complete overview of the Java security architecture and security classes, plus a wealth of detailed information and code examples for specific implementations. The book opens with a clear discussion of what Java security is, how the various Java sandbox models work, and how Java applications and applets execute within the security model. The following chapters look in depth at the elements of the Java security architecture: language rules, class loaders, the security manager, the access controller, and permission objects. All these chapters provide detailed information on implementation, as well as an excellent explanation of the role of each feature within the entire security picture. The second half of the book covers cryptographic features in the Java security package (much enhanced in Java 1.2) and how Java programs work with code that performs authentication and encryption. Here, you'll find detailed chapters on message digests, keys and certificates, key management, digital signatures, and the Java Cryptography Extensions. Anyone who needs to understand Java security, but especially those who will implement security features in Java applications, will want to own this book.

review: This pocket guide features quick-reference information to help you  use Oracle's PL/SQL language. It includes coverage of PL/SQL features in the  newest version of Oracle, Oracle8i.  It is a companion to Steven Feuerstein  and Bill Pribyl's bestselling Oracle PL/SQL Programming. Updated for  Oracle8, that large volume (nearly 1,000 pages) fills a huge gap in the  Oracle market, providing developers with a single, comprehensive guide to  building applications with PL/SQL -- and building them the right way. It  has become the bible for PL/SQL developers, who have raved about its  completeness, readability, and practicality.  This pocket reference boils down the most vital information from Oracle PL/SQL Programming into an accessible quick reference that summarizes the basics of PL/SQL: its block structure, fundamental language elements (e.g., identifiers, declarations,  defaults), data structures (including Oracle8 objects), and  statements for program control, loops, exception handling, and  database access. It also covers the the basics of using Oracle's  procedures, functions, and packages.Book InfoDistills the most vital information from Oracle PL/SQL Programming into an accessible summary of fundamental language elements, statements for program control, cursor management, and exception handling.

review: <I>Perl & LWP</I> sets out to unwrap the Library for the Web in Perl (LWP), which is a collection of modules that make it easier to access and pick apart Web pages (and FTP-accessible files, and outgoing e-mail messages) from within your Perl programs. The book succeeds wonderfully, not only in conveying the technical aspects of LWP programming, but in making clear the fun of doing work that's very well suited to Perl. Sean Burke assumes that his readers know something about Perl, albeit not much, and a similar amount about HTML. He does a great job of explaining how LWP functions fit into Perl programs, and how you can use them to make reference to Internet resources far more easily than before.<p>Burke's narrative takes the form of a guided tour in which he introduces his readers to aspects of the LWP modules one by one. His tone is generally straightforward (sharp commentary alternates with brief code listings, with occasional passages of reference material), but there's sometimes an undercurrent of exuberance that makes the reader want to get going with his or her own programming right away. Overall, the emphasis is on teaching both LWP and Perl itself to the extent necessary to do LWP work. Because of the concise and nicely indexed code modules, though, you'll find this book useful as a reference after you're under way with LWP. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> How to program with LWP and Perl itself. All of LWP's strong points--including HTML parsing (with tokens and trees as well as with regular expressions), HTML generation and modification, manipulation of HTML forms, and the operation of spiders--are covered. This book has more of a tutorial tone than any similar reference material on the Internet.

review: Defying the stereotypical notion that technical books tend to be boring, <I>Expert C Programming</I> offers a lively and often humorous look at many aspects of C--from how memory is laid out to the details of pointers and arrays. The author reveals his points through invaluable anecdotes, such as stories of costly bugs, and through folklore, such as the contents of Donald Knuth's first publication. Each chapter ends with a section entitled "Some Light Relief," which discusses topics (topics that some may consider to be "recreational"), such as programming contests. A fabulous appendix on job interview questions finishes the book.

review: There's only so much you can do by multitasking applications. Frequently, you just need another computer for testing software, trying out network configurations, or doing any of a dozen things that engineers and administrators need to do. VMware allows you to run several virtual machines on one physical computer, each completely independent of the others at all levels and each potentially running a different operating system. <I>The Book of VMware</I> provides full documentation on running both versions of this tremendously useful utility--Windows and Linux--and goes into great detail on how it goes about dividing the resources of a single physical box. If you want to know how the Linux version of VMware manages the file systems of a Windows guest operating system, or how USB devices are shared across multiple virtual machines, this book is the single best resource for you.<p>Brian Ward's prose style is pretty dry; you won't read this one from front to back, and it's unlikely you'll even read a chapter straight through unless you're encountering a problem and want to know everything potentially related to it. More likely, you'll use the index to locate Ward's coverage of FreeBSD disk-lettering schemes (or whatever) and read the several pages of text and illustrations he devotes to the matter. This is a specialized reference book, and a very good one. <I>--David Wall</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> All aspects of VMware 3.0 Workstation (from VMware Corporation) for both the Windows and Linux versions of the software. Coverage of the two variants is approximately equal. In addition to explaining how to install both kinds of VMware, the author shows how guest systems behave--in terms of disk usage, driver compatibility, device sharing, networking, and all other major  systems--in both environments. There's great coverage of FreeBSD as a guest system.

review: The appearance of the second edition of <I>CGI Programming with Perl</I>  heralds the beginning of the neoclassical era of Web service. CGI--or common  gateway interface--is the original back end for client-driven, dynamic Web-page  service and deserves consideration as the Romulus of the Internet Empire. But,  where first-edition author Gundavaram described the lonely Romulus laying the  brick foundation of dynamic Web-page service in 1996, second-edition  collaborators Guelich and Birznieks have pitched in to resurrect Romulus amid  the crowded streets of modern Rome. Why bother? Surely four years have brought  technological revolutions (Java, PHP, ASP, ColdFusion) that render CGI's  original brick-by-brick approach as obsolete as, say, Roman mythology--or bricks  and mortar.<p>  And yet not. It is an ambiguous blessing that the original CGI persists,  adhering to the underside of Web service by the duct tape that is Perl. This  point is not missed by Guelich, Gundavaram, and Birznieks, whose advocacy of CGI  is both bolstered by the growing applications module base of Perl and tempered  by their awareness of CGI's structural limitations. Both new and returning  readers of <I>CGI Programming with Perl</I> should browse the last chapter first  in order to appreciate the proposed solutions to CGI's greatest sin: its  impractical slowness in a world of a million-hits-per-day Web service. The  chapter describes CGI-compatible FastCGI and mod_perl technologies that  circumvent the process-spawning slowness of the simple CGI. Advanced users might  want to skip directly to O'Reilly's fine mod_perl tome, <I>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and  C</I>, by Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern.<p>  The authors' second pass at CGI pedagogy is a lucid, honest, and expanded  account that develops functionality of dynamic Web pages in a rational  progression--from HTML client-server and CGI syntax basics to general  input/output, forms, e-mail, graphics, and simple database applications,  including maintaining client state and data persistence under the otherwise  stateless HTTP protocol. The authors offer synopses of cookies, JavaScripting,  server security, and XML, all of which are described in detail in other  books.<p>  Whether or not neoclassical CGI is fast enough for your purposes--perhaps for  guarded intranets--bear in mind that CGI is the standard to which every other  Web server has had to respond. The second edition of <I>CGI Programming with  Perl</I> is still the best introduction to the classics. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

review: Assuming a familiarity with SQL and at least one Java enterprise API, this book describes the different approaches Java provides for database programming, assesses what approaches fit which problems, and recommends best practices for each model. The author discusses data architecture, transaction management, EJB container-managed persistence, EJB bean-managed persistence, and Java data objects persistence.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionJava Database Best Practices rescues you from having to slog through books on each of the various APIs before figuring out which method to use! This guide introduces each of the dominant APIs, explores the methodology and design components that use those APIs, and then offers practices most appropriate for different types and makes of databases, and different types of applications.  Java Database Practices also examines database design, from table and database architecture to normalization, and offers a number of best practices for handling these tasks as well. Learn how to move through the various forms of normalization, understand when to denormalize, and even get detailed instructions on optimizing your SQL queries to make the best use of your database structure. Through it all, this book focuses on practical application of these techniques, giving you information that can immediately be applied to your own enterprise projects.

review: <I>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</I> is an excellent text that provides encyclopedic coverage of the TCP/IP protocol suite. What sets this book apart from others on this subject is the fact that the author supplements all of the discussion with data collected via diagnostic programs; thus, it is possible to "watch" the protocols in action in a real situation. Also, the diagnostic tools involved are publicly available; the reader has the opportunity to play along at home. This offers the reader an unparalleled opportunity to really get a feel for the behavior of the protocols in day-to-day operation. <I>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols</I> features clear discussions and well-designed figures.<P> Volume two of this series, <I>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation</I>, covers the implementation of TCP/IP. Volume three explores <I>TCP for Transactions, HTTP, NNTP, and the Unix Domain Protocols</I>.

review: Holzner, who has taught at MIT and Cornell, offers Java developers advice on installing the Eclipse open source IDE and getting started with its Java development toolkit (JDT). The 170 solutions address refactoring operations, the JUnit testing framework, the concurrent version system (CVS) for working in teams, Ant build files, and the standard widget toolkit (SWT). The cookbook covers Eclipse 2.1.2, but highlights new features to expect in version 3.0.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionYou've probably heard the buzz about Eclipse, the powerful open source platform that gives Java developers a new way to approach development projects. It's like a shiny new car--no longer content to just admire Eclipse, you're now itching to get in and drive.   Eclipse is to Java developers what Visual Studio is to .NET developers--it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines a code editor, compiler, debugger, text editor, graphical user interface (GUI) builder, and other components into a single, user-friendly application. It provides a solid foundation that enables Java developers to construct and run integrated software-development tools for web development, application design, modeling, performance, testing, and much more.  As with any extensive programming tool, however, there's a lot to learn. And there s no better guy than well-known Java expert Steve Holzner to teach you. An award-winning and best-selling author who has been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared, Holzner delivers just the kind of targeted, practical, everyday knowledge you need to hone your mastery of Eclipse.  Perfect as a companion to an Eclipse programming tutorial (such as Holzner's own Eclipse, O'Reilly, April 2004) or an ideal stand-alone for all those developers who either don't want or don't need the tutorial approach, the Eclipse Cookbook contains task-oriented recipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter while using this new Java platform--from deploying a web application automatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming all references to a class across multiple packages to initializing the SWT JNI libraries.  Each recipe in the ever-popular and utterly practical problem-solution-discussion format for O'Reilly cookbooks contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a brief but complete discussion of a solution, and in-action examples illustrating that solution. The Eclipse Cookbook will satiate Java programmers at all levels who are ready to go beyond tutorials--far beyond writing plug-ins and extensions--and actually use the powerful and convenient Eclipse day to day.

review: The JFC/Swing classes offer a powerful way to build user interfaces in Java, and this richness comes with a lot more complexity. <I>Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell</I> provides the documentation needed for understanding the most important features of Swing and serves as a handy reference to every package, class, and method. <p> The book is especially good at introducing the essential elements of Swing compared to the older AWT standard. Early chapters compare the fundamentals of AWT and Swing, including the architecture of each, plus the new possibilities for user interfaces offered by today's Swing. Standout sections on Java2D graphics (which is a lot more complicated than AWT graphics), printing, and Swing's advanced UI capabilities round out the tour here. Short examples and clear explanations, somewhat dryly written, provide a starting point for learning Swing.<p> The heart of this book is its 500 pages of reference material for every Java Swing (and AWT) package, class, and method. Some readers may quibble with the ordering here. (For instance, the model classes for advanced UI components like JTables are separated from the components themselves).

review: This guide offers details on installing, configuring, and running the web caching software Squid.  It covers basics like downloading, compiling, and installing code, as well as advanced topics like storage options, rewriting requests, HTTP sever acceleration, monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting.  Wessels works for a company that evaluates the performance, compliance, and security of HTTP intermediaries.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionSquid is the most popular Web caching software in use today, and it works on a variety of platforms including Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Squid improves network performance by reducing the amount of bandwidth used when surfing the Web. It makes web pages load faster and can even reduce the load on your web server. By caching and reusing popular web content, Squid allows you to get by with smaller network connections. It also protects the host on your internal network by acting as a firewall and proxying your internal web traffic. You can use Squid to collect statistics about the traffic on your network, prevent users from visiting inappropriate web sites at work or school, ensure that only authorized users can surf the Internet, and enhance your privacy by filtering sensitive information from web requests. Companies, schools, libraries, and organizations that use web-caching proxies can look forward to a multitude of benefits.   Written by Duane Wessels, the creator of Squid, Squid: The Definitive Guide will help you configure and tune Squid for your particular situation. Newcomers to Squid will learn how to download, compile, and install code. Seasoned users of Squid will be interested in the later chapters, which tackle advanced topics such as high-performance storage options, rewriting requests, HTTP server acceleration, monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting Squid.   Topics covered include:   Compiling and installing Squid   Running Squid   Using Squid's sophisticated access controls   Tuning disk storage for optimal performance   Configuring your operating system for HTTP interception   Forwarding Requests to other web caches   Using redirectors to rewrite user requests   Monitoring Squid with the cache manager and SNMP   Using Squid to accelerate and protect HTTP servers   Managing bandwidth consumption with Delay Pools

review: Updated to cover version 2.4.x of the Linux kernel, the second edition of <I>Linux Device Drivers</I> remains the best general-purpose, paper-bound guide for programmers wishing to make hardware devices work under the world's most popular open-source operating system. The authors take care to show how to write drivers that are portable--that is, that compile and run under all popular Linux platforms. That, along with the fact that they're careful to explain and illustrate concepts, makes this book very well suited to any programmer familiar with C but not with the hardware-software interface. It's worth noting that the emphasis in the title is on "device drivers" as much as "Linux." This book will make sense to you if you've never written a driver for any platform before. It helps if you have some Linux or Unix background, but even that is secondary as a prerequisite to C skill.<p>  For a programming text--and one concerned with low-level instructions and data structures, at that--this book is remarkably rich in prose. You'll typically want to read this book straight through, more or less skipping the code samples, before sketching out your plan for the driver you need to write. Then, go back and pay closer attention to the sections on specific details you need to implement, like custom task queues. For coding-time details about specific system calls and programming techniques, count on the index to point you to the right passages. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Techniques for writing hardware device drivers that run under Linux kernels 2.0.x through 2.2.x. Sections show how to manage memory, time, interrupts, ports, and other details of the hardware-software interface.

review: <I>Python Programming on Win32</I> zeroes in on the strengths of the Python programming language for the Windows platform. If you would like to use Python on Windows with Office 2000, this book is a perfect choice for getting started. While it's not an introduction to Python programming itself, the book does present some basic Python examples. (The authors do provide an impressive list of real-world projects that have used Python successfully, including an application at NASA and a major Web search engine.) <p> In lieu of a general language tour, this book centers on practical tips and examples for using Python on Windows, beginning with downloading and installing the free Python package. The most useful examples here present a Python library for general accounting objects. You'll learn how to write COM servers in Python and then how to script them in Visual Basic (used here to build user interfaces) and how to control Word and Excel with OLE Automation in Python. One standout example looks at building and printing accounting reports in Office 2000 using Python as the script language.<p> Later sections look at other possibilities, including how to use Python's support for MFC to build user interfaces. A notable section here looks at Windows NT system administration in Python. Because of its built-in support for dictionaries, Python is a natural fit for working with users, groups, permissions, and the like.<p> While Python's initial habitat may be Unix, <I>Python Programming on Win32</I> shows that this powerful and increasingly popular object-oriented language may find its next home on Windows. Provided you have some previous exposure to the language, this book is an excellent resource for using Python in a Windows setting. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Python programming quick-start, Windows Python basics, Python support for COM/DCOM, the Pythonwin editor, Office 2000 scripting, Windows NT administration and system programming, Python MFC programming, and Active Scripting.

review: Too many network administrators depend on the "big sky" principle of  network security--they believe that the large number of Internet-connected  machines out there will keep black-hat hackers away. <I>Hack Proofing Your  Network: Internet Tradecraft</I> points out that statistics are no defense, and  that such an attitude is irresponsible. The book shows steps that you can take  to harden your resources against attack. Although most of the material in this  book isn't up-to-the-minute (how could it be, when the tactics of attackers  change daily), you can discourage hackers by implementing the strategies that it  describes.<p>  Many antihacking texts assume a fair bit of knowledge, but this one doesn't.  Ryan Russell and coauthors explain many terms and concepts, such as traffic  sniffing, cryptography, and file differentiation ("diffing"), and the tools that  evildoers use to wreak havoc on the systems that they attack--complete with  Internet addresses from which you can download them. The book walks you through  sample attacks, too, such as hijacking a connection by using a tool called Hunt.  Overall, this is a fine introductory-to-intermediate antihacking volume that  leads well into more current and advanced resources. You might want to  supplement it with two other practical computer-security books: <I>Hacking Exposed</I> catalogues many  of the tools that bad guys use, while <I>Network Intrusion Detection</I>  helps you analyze security logs and spot attacks in progress. <I>--David  Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Modes of attack, and means of defending against  them <li>Political environment governing software and networking <li>Laws and  policies springing from that environment <li>Approaches to the problem of  breaking into systems or denying their services to legitimate users <li>Spoofing  <li>Sniffing <li>Transmission interception <li>Several other popular  tactics</ul>

review: If you already have Java programming experience and are looking to program games, this book is for you. David Brackeen, along with co-authors Bret Barker and Lawrence Vanhelsuwe, show you how to make fast, full-screen action games such as side scrollers and 3D shooters. Key features covered in this book include Java 2 game programming techniques, including latest 2D graphics and sound technologies, 3D graphics and scene management, path-finding and artificial intelligence, collision detection, game scripting using BeanShell, and multi-player game engine creation.From the AuthorDuring the course of writing Developing Games in Java, I would inform friends that I secured the movie rights to the book. My sister kept saying that I was going to end up on Oprah's book club. On breaks I would get a head rush from standing up too fast, and have hallucinations of 3D vectors, anonymous inner classes, and graph algorithms implemented in Java. I would walk into the living room and say I can see in 3D! and my roommate would just nod politely.   But I try to keep the blatant lies out of this book. Instead, Developing Games in Java is filled with tons of useful game programming information. And not just because New Riders chained me to my desk - mostly because people wouldn't stop bothering me until I told them everything I know. Which is a good thing, because I tend to forget everything I know, but now that I've written it down, I can re-learn stuff I've forgotten. If it's too confusing, you can always wait for Developing Games in Java: The Movie coming in 2004.

review: Written for readers with at least some Perl programming experience, <I>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</I> delivers a solid library of algorithms written in Perl for business and mathematical computing. From data structures to cryptography and more advanced mathematical algorithms, this book provides a worthwhile guide to extending Perl's coding capabilities.<p> The best thing about <I>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</I> is the scope at which it covers the universe of algorithms while refraining from getting bogged down in academic detail. Besides basic data structures--a lynchpin of books on algorithms--the authors provide dozens and dozens of algorithms for sorting, searching, and doing mathematical computations of all kinds. While they discuss "Big-O" notation and assume a general familiarity with math, they don't overwhelm the reader. (You can even borrow the code without needing a math degree to understand it.) The focus is on efficient, reusable Perl subroutines written and compiled by three Perl experts.<p> Standout chapters include extending Perl's already powerful string processing abilities, game programming, and cryptography. Generally, the authors achieve a good mix of more advanced (and less well-known) algorithms, along with the basics. Chances are you won't need to use all the dozen or so sorting algorithms presented here, but the authors include them all, just in case. As a reference and tutorial, readers can pick and choose what they need for real-world Perl development.<p> There hasn't been a book dedicated exclusively to Perl algorithms prior to the publication of this one. In all, <I>Mastering Algorithms in Perl</I> fills a useful niche by compiling a powerful library of Perl algorithms that will be useful for anyone who works with this programming language, whether in business or academic computing. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Perl data types, Big-O notation, data structures, queues, deques, linked lists, binary trees, sorting and searching algorithms, game and dynamic programming, sets and multisets, matrices and graphs, string matching and parsing, 2-D geometry, number systems, cryptography (including DES and RSA), probability, statistics, and numerical analysis.

review: Jesse Liberty's <I>Programming C#</I> provides an adept and  extremely well conceived guide to the C# language and is written for  the developer with some previous C++, Java, and/or Visual Basic  experience.<p>It's no secret that many computer books are pretty much  devoid of an authorial personality. This title is a winning exception.  The author is able to weave in clever examples (using such topics as  his own long experience in computing, his dog, <i>Star Trek</i>, etc.)  without being coy or getting in the way of presenting real technical  information. Liberty's wide experience in computers and general writing  skill shows, as he is able to draw on a wealth of examples to move his  text forward.<p>These are a couple of goals at work in <I>Programming  C#</I>. First, it's an excellent language tutorial, certainly one of  the smartest and best available guides to C# as a language. Early  chapters explore basic and obscure language options using inheritance,  delegation, interface, and the conventions in C# used to implement  these techniques. The middle part of the book turns toward the .NET  Framework itself, with two useful (and somewhat introductory) chapters  on both Windows Forms and Web Forms, for standalone and Web-based  applications, respectively.<p>Later sections crank up the technical  knowledge again with several advanced topics on understanding .NET  assemblies and deployment in detail, as well as "reflection" APIs that  allow .NET programs to essentially modify their code at run time. (One  technique, reflection emit, which literally writes bytecodes, will  definitely interest expert readers, though it's unlikely most  programmers will need to do this.) Final sections look at the .NET  stream classes (rivaled only by Java's for complexity). Liberty looks  at basic file and network I/O as well as how objects get serialized and  marshaled both for SOAP and Web services and "normal" .NET  remoting.<p>The author's sure hand here in navigating the difficult  waters of C# and .NET makes for a relatively concise text that is  chock-full of useful information on C#. Filled with notably clever and  inventive examples, this book is possibly this veteran computer  author's best title to date, and it's sure to be a noteworthy resource  as experienced developers tackle C# for the first time. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I> <p> <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul> <li>Introduction to C# and the .NET platform <li>A "Hello World" example in C# <li>Tutorial to C# as an object-oriented programming language (types  and variables, operators, namespaces, and preprocessor directives)  <li>Defining classes in C# (including static members, finalizers,  overloading, and read-only fields)  <li>Inheritance and polymorphism implemented in C#  <li>Operator overloading  <li>Structures in C#, interfaces, arrays, and indexers  <li>Built-in .NET collections, strings, and regular expression support  <li>Structured exception handling  <li>Delegate and events  <li>Introduction to programming with Windows Forms  <li>ADO.NET database APIs (including basic XML support)  <li>Quick introduction to Web Forms and ASP.NET used with C#  <li>Introduction to Web services (SOAP, WSDL, and Discover services  described)  <li>In-depth guide to .NET assemblies (including metadata, versioning,  private and shared assemblies)  <li>C# support for attributes and reflection (including reflection emit  techniques)  <li>Marshaling and remoting (with and without SOAP)  <li>Threads and synchronization  <li>Tutorial to C#/.NET streams (including basic I/O techniques, Web  streams, and serialization)  <li>COM and .NET interoperability </ul>

Topics include how to rip and burn music CDs using various formats (and using MusicMatch Jukebox on older Windows PCs); how to play songs across a network; how to manage playlists and purchase music from the iTunes music store; how the iPod can be used as an extra hard disk or startup disk; accessories such as scratch- proof cases, speakers, stands, and cables; using the iPod as a calendar; e-games and e-books; and troubleshooting. The second edition covers iTunes and the iTunes Music Store for Mac and Windows and the new iPod Mini.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionThe iPod is the world's bestselling music player. But if you think that it's just a music player, then you must think Clark Kent is just a newspaperman.   In this freshly updated edition, New York Times tech columnist J. D. Biersdorfer blows open the secret doors of this gleaming, chrome-and-white beauty. With humor and authority, she lays bare an astonishing collection of useful tips, tricks, and shortcuts like these:   iPod as PalmPilot. The iPod can suck in your calendar, address book, to-do list, and notes from a Mac or PC, and then display them at the touch of a button. It also doubles as an alarm clock and stopwatch.   iPod as hard drive. You can use your iPod to carry gigantic files from place to place.   iPod as e-book. The iPod makes an excellent book reader, capable of scrolling through recipes, driving directions, and even Web pages.   iPod as GameBoy. The iPod's games are perfect time-killers for waiting rooms, bus rides, and the Department of Motor Vehicles.   iPod & iTunes: The Missing Manual, 2nd Edition is much more than it seems, too. It not only covers all iPod models for both Mac and Windows, including the iPod Mini, it's also the ultimate guide to the iTunes software, MusicMatch Jukebox, and the new iTunes Music Store for both Mac and Windows.   No matter what kind of music moves you, iPod & iTunes: The Missing Manual, 2nd Edition will help you get much more out of your iPod--and much more into it.

review: Larry Wall wrote Perl and he wrote <I>Programming Perl</I>. Better yet,  he writes amusingly and well--all of which comes across in this latest edition  of the definitive guide to the language.<p>  Like Topsy, Perl just grew, and as a result the need for a third edition came  about. It's now over 1,000 pages, which it needs to be, as it performs several  different duties. First, it's an introduction to the Perl language for those who  are new to programming; also, it's a guide for those who are coming from other  languages; and, finally, it's a Perl language reference. <p>  Among Larry Wall's other pursuits is being a linguist, and it's perhaps for this  reason that Perl is a peculiarly flexible language with many routes to achieving  the same ends, as the authors ably demonstrate. It's also extensible in several  ways, designed to work with many other languages. Also, as it's largely  interpreted, programs written in Perl tend to run unmodified on a variety of  platforms--although platform-specific Perl modules and programming practices are  also discussed.<p>  A major strength of <I>Programming Perl</I> is the way subject areas are  approached from several directions. This constant shift of viewpoint eliminates  blind spots in the reader's understanding and provides a pleasing echo of the  way Perl itself can take many routes from here to there. <p>  Because the Perl community is both knowledgeable and active, the language covers  much more ground here than in the previous edition. Even if you have both  previous editions, you'll want this latest version--if only for the new jokes.  <I>--Steve Patient, amazon.co.uk</I>

review: This comprehensive wireless network book addresses the operational and day-to-day security management requirements of 21st century companies. Wireless networks can easily be reconfigured, are very mobile, allow for potentially nonstop exposure, and require the level of security be scrutinized even more than for wired networks. This includes inherent security flaws in various wireless architectures that result in additional risks to otherwise secure converged wired networks. An even worse scenario is one where an insecure wireless network is connected to a weakly secured or insecure wired network and the wireless subnet is not separated from the wired subnet. There are approximately a dozen popular books that cover components of the architecture, design, theory, issues, challenges, and recommended policies for wireless security, none of which address them in a practical, operationally-oriented and comprehensive way. Wireless Operational Security bridges this gap.*Presents a new WISDOM model for Wireless Security Infrastructures*Acts as a critical guide to implementing Converged Networks wired/wireless with all necessary security considerations*Rittinghouse's Cybersecurity Operations Handbook is the only security book recommended by the FCC

He includes expert advice on putting the methodologies to use in both individual projects and across the organization and provides detailed guidance on maintenance and support.      Buy it today!      &#160;    From the Inside FlapEffective project management is the key to achieving business goals in today&#146;s fast-paced, highly competitive organizations. In almost every industry, from construction to information technology, good project management is now a requirement. As project methodologies multiply, knowing how to choose and implement the right methodology for a particular goal is becoming ever more complicated, even for highly experienced project managers.    Project Management Methodologies presents a comprehensive survey of the tools, tips, techniques, and tactics that are available to guide project managers to the successful completion of their projects. Seasoned project management consultant Jay Charvat presents a detailed description of each methodology currently available, weighs the advantages and disadvantages of each, and provides a plan for implementation. He also offers peerless advice on what project managers can do to redesign and improve the efficiency of methodologies and processes that are already in place.    Ideal for neophytes and experienced project managers alike, the book not only lets project managers choose from available methodologies, but also shows upper-level management how these methodologies can be used to establish a core project management competency within an organization. But good project management doesn&#146;t end when a methodology is chosen. Therefore, techniques are provided for the maintenance and support of both project specific and organizational project methodologies, as well as descriptions of the various roles and responsibilities of the support function.    Case studies of real organizations that have designed and deployed their own custom methodologies are included to help project managers understand the full range of possibilities for each project. Questions&#150;with answers provided in an appendix&#150;follow each chapter to highlight and reinforce major themes and topics. A CD-ROM is available separately at http://www.jasoncharvat.com/sales.html which includes more than 120 tried-and-true project management templates that can be utilized immediately, saving the time required to design custom templates.    With the full range of available methodologies, expert advice on putting them to use in both individual projects and across the organization, and detailed guidance on maintenance and support, Project Management Methodologies covers all the bases. It&#146;s everything project managers need to build and manage the methodologies that lead to proven success.

review: Three members of the Subversion open source development team explain the basic concepts behind tracking changes to source code, then show how to create a repository, make it available over a Unix-based network, copy changes between branches, and configure runtime options. The final chapter is a reference guide to command line client (svn) and repository administration commands.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionOne of the greatest frustrations in most software projects is version control: the art of managing changes to information. Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play.  Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, Version Control with Subversion introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS.  CVS users will find the look and feel Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws.  The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure.  With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor.  Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control.  The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide.  Version Control with Subversion aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins.  If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.

review: Building dynamic Web sites often means learning about CGI--the Common Gateway Interface that specifies how server-based programs interact with a Web server. <i>CGI Programming Unleashed</i> shows how to use CGI for a variety of common tasks such as processing forms, polling users, hosting discussions, and implementing "shopping carts." The book's strength is its breadth, not depth--there are plenty of code samples, but they're fairly dense and you'll be left to do much of the interpretation yourself. Novice programmers may find the going tough, but experienced ones who want to learn how to use CGI quickly will be right at home.

review: Tate (a consultant) and Gehtland (a programmer) argue for lightweight open source architectures, and present two examples of what they have in mind--Hibernate and Spring. They thus encourage Java developers to rethink the way they work, and offer both fundamental concepts and practical techniques for building simpler code.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionSometimes the simplest answer is the best. Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with heavyweight Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.  In Better, Faster, Lighter Java, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code.  As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two lightweight open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.   Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. Better, Faster, Lighter Java shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.  Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, Better, Faster, Lighter Java, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.  You'll learn to spend more time on what's important. When you're finished with this book, you'll find that your Java is better, faster, and lighter than ever before.

review: Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes.  It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns.  A software design pattern can be identified as a recurring solution to a recurring problem. Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another?  But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started.  Crawford and Kaplan's J2EE Design Patterns approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software.  They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability.   J2EE Design Patterns offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face:Maintenance (Extensibility)Performance (System Scalability)Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling)Transactions (process Modeling)Messaging (Interoperability)And with its careful balance between theory and practice, J2EE Design Patterns will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience.

review: Among network designers and administrators, wired Ethernet is a known quantity. Plenty is known about how to build good twisted-pair network infrastructures, how to keep them secure, and how to monitor their excess capacity. Not so for the wireless Ethernet networks (built around the IEEE 802.11x standards)--these hold much more mystery for even experienced network designers. <I>802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide</I> aims to codify the body of knowledge needed to design and maintain wireless local area networks (LANs). The authors succeed admirably in this, covering what installation and administration teams need to know and digging into information of use to driver writers and others working at lower levels.<p>  The only significant detail that's been excluded has to do with security--a notorious weak point of 802.11x LANs. The authors cover the feeble but widely used Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) authentication protocol in detail and devote another whole chapter to 802.1x, which is an emerging authentication scheme based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). The author has considerable skill in communicating information graphically and does a great job of using graphs to show how communications frequencies shift over time and how conversations among access points and network nodes progress over time. This is indeed an authoritative document. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> How IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b wireless networks (also known as WiFi networks) work, and how to configure your own. The framing specification is covered well, as are authentication protocols and (in detail) the physical phenomena that affect IEEE 802.11x radio transmissions. There's advice on how to design a wireless network topology, and how to go about network traffic analysis and performance improvement.

review: The first volume of <I>Unix Network Programming</I>, <I>Networking APIs: Sockets and XTI</I> covers just about everything you need to know to get your applications to talk to other computers on a network. In this second volume, W. Richard Stevens discusses what you need to know to get your applications to talk to other applications running on your computer. There's a big difference, and Stevens covers it well.<p> Stevens introduces the reader to the internal structures of Posix interprocess communication (IPC) and System V (SysV) IPC; pipes and first in, first outs (FIFOs); message queues; how to lock and unlock files and records; semaphores; shared memory; and remote procedure calls (RPCs). He explains the difference between the Posix and SysV implementations of semaphores, message queues, and shared memory. There are also plenty of notes and examples for the reader.<p> This book is invaluable for programmers because it explains all of those little "gotchas" that always seem to pop up. In addition, the explanations of the differences between Posix IPC and SysV IPC really help readers decide which version they'd like to use for their applications. <I>--Doug Beaver</I>

review: Windows XP is the latest, most reliable, and best-looking version of the world's most widely used operating system, combining the extremely stable engine of Windows NT and 2000 with the user-friendliness of the Windows 98 and Me consumer models. In its first year, XP became the fastest-selling Windows OS ever. But one major failing remains unaddressed: XP Pro comes without a single page of printed instructions.  This superbly written guide fills the gap. Coauthored by David Pogue, New York Times technology columnist and Missing Manuals creator, Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual uses wit, technical insight, and scrupulous objectivity to light the way for first-time and intermediate PC fans. The book reveals which features work well and which don't, such as the Remote Desktop software that enables people to connect to the office from home, the encryption file system that protects sensitive information, and the Windows Messenger that enables real-time text, voice and video communication. Contents include:Getting started. The book's early chapters cover using menus, finding lost files, reducing window clutter, and taming the new, multi-column Start menu.Mastering the network. Special chapters help you navigate the corporate network, dial in from the road, and even set up your own small-office (peer-to-peer) network, step by step.Understanding security. User accounts, file encryption, and the NTFS file system keep your private files private, while still offering network access to coworkers you specify.Flying the Net. This book demystifies Outlook Express 6 for email, Internet Explorer 6 for Web browsing, and the new Windows Messenger for voice, chat, and video conferencing.Windows XP Pro: The Missing Manual isn't for system administrators or OS theory geeks; it's for the novice or budding power user who wants to master the machine and get down to work. Yet, anyone who uses XP Pro (including hardcore techies) will find this new system much easier -- and more fun -- to digest with this new Missing Manual. This is the crystal-clear, jargon-free book that should have been in the box.

review: Intended for PHP 4 programmers, this book documents the new and updated features in version 5, and provides side-by-side code comparisons that illustrate what changes may need to be made to current code. Trachtenberg, who is a manager at eBay, describes PHP 5's expanded support for object-oriented programming, integrated suite of XML tools, new MySQL extension, introduction of iterators, and web services with SOAP.Copyright &#169; 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, ORBook DescriptionIf you're using PHP 4, then chances are good that an upgrade to PHP 5 is in your future.  The more you've heard about the exciting new features in PHP 5, the sooner that upgrade is probably going to be. Although an in-depth, soup-to-nuts reference guide to the language is good to have on hand, it's not the book an experienced PHP programmer needs to get started with the latest release. What you need is a lean and focused guide that answers your most pressing questions: what's new with the technology, what's different, and how do I make the best use of it?  In other words, you need a copy of Upgrading to PHP 5.  This book is targeted toward PHP developers who are already familiar with PHP 4.  Rather than serve as a definitive guide to the entire language, the book zeroes in on PHP 5's new features, and covers these features definitively. You'll find a concise appraisal of the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5, a detailed look at what's new in this latest version, and you'll see how PHP 5 improves on PHP 4 code.  See PHP 4 and PHP 5 code side-by-side, to learn how the new features make it easier to solve common PHP problems.  Each new feature is shown in code, helping you understand why it's there, when to use it, and how it's better than PHP 4. Short, sample programs are included throughout the book.   Topics covered in Upgrading to PHP 5 include:The new set of robust object-oriented programming featuresAn improved MySQL extension, supporting MySQL 4.1, prepared statements, and bound parametersCompletely rewritten support for XML: DOM, XSLT, SAX, and SimpleXMLEasy web services with SOAPSQLite, an embedded database library bundled with PHP 5Cleaner error handling with exceptionsOther new language features, such as iterators, streams, and more. Upgrading to PHP 5 won't make you wade through information you've covered before. Written by Adam Trachtenberg, coauthor of the popular PHP Cookbook, this book will take you straight into the heart of all that's new in PHP 5.  By the time you've finished, you'll know PHP 5 in practice as well as in theory.
