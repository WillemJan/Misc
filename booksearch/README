booksearch - Search for book metadata

BookSearch is a collection of protocols, formats and endpoints
for book metadata search via libraries, research institutes and
commercial available endpoints, implemented in Python.

BookSearch is able to search your local national library, if they
expose an endpoint, many of them do, without the need for keys,
and they provide rich info. The aim of this project is to provide
easy access to different sources of metadata, in a parallel fashion.

There are a couple of standards required to search the metadata 
providers, some well known, others more obscure. To get a sense of
the search protocols, see search protocol overview. Metadata in the
library world can take on many forms, for an overview of the
implemented metadata formats see metadata formats overview.

Booksearch launches queries to it's endpoints in parallel mode,
results are collected as they come in, user is free to design
result merge strategies.
